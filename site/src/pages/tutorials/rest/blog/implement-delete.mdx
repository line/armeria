# Implementing DELETE operation

In this step, we'll write a method for deleting a blog post. By completing this step, you'll learn to map your service with the HTTP DELETE (<type://@Delete>) method, customize an exception handler, and use a blocking task executor.

<TutorialSteps current={7} />

## What you need

You must have the following files ready for deleting a blog post. You can always [download](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/blob/main/tutorials/rest-api-annotated-service/src/main/java/example/armeria/server/blog/) the full version, instead of creating one yourself.

- Main.java from [Step 1. Create a server](/tutorials/rest/blog/create-server)
- BlogPost.java from [Step 2. Prepare a data object](/tutorials/rest/blog/prepare-data-object)
- BlogService.java from [Step 3. Add services to a server](/tutorials/rest/blog/add-services-to-server)

<Warning>

To test deleting a blog post, you need to have blog posts created, which requires you to have the creation method implemented in the BlogService.java. See [Step 4. Implement CREATE](/tutorials/rest/blog/implement-create) for instructions.

</Warning>

## 1. Map HTTP method

Let's start [mapping the HTTP DELETE method](/docs/server-annotated-service#mapping-http-service-methods) with our service method:

1. Declare a service method, `deleteBlogPost()` in the class `BlogService`.
2. Map this service method with the HTTP DELETE method by adding the <type://@Delete> annotation.
3. Bind the endpoint `/blogs` to the method.

```java filename=BlogService.java highlight=6
import com.linecorp.armeria.server.annotation.Delete;

public final class BlogService {
  ...

  @Delete("/blogs")
  public void deleteBlogPost(int id) {
    // Delete a blog post
  }
}
```

## 2. Handle parameters

Let's take the blog post ID (`id`) as a path parameter for identifying the post to delete.

1. Take in the ID value as a path parameter by adding `/blogs/:id` to the <type://@Delete> annotation.
2. [Inject the path parameter](/docs/server-annotated-service#parameter-injection) to the service method by annotating the parameter with <type://@Param>.

  ```java filename=BlogService.java highlight=6-7
  import com.linecorp.armeria.server.annotation.Param;

  public final class BlogService {
    ...

    @Delete("/blogs/:id")
    public void deleteBlogPost(@Param int id) {
      // Delete a blog post
    }
  }
  ```

## 3. Implement service code

In this step, write the code to delete a blog post, handle an exception, and block the operation.

- [Delete a blog post](#delete-a-blog-post)
- [Handle exceptions](#handle-exceptions)
- [Add blocking](#add-blocking)

### Delete a blog post

Deleting a given blog post in this tutorial means removing a blog post from the map, `blogPosts`. However, in real services you would be performing this action on a database.

To delete a blog post, copy line 3 into the `deleteBlogPost()` method.

```java filename=BlogService.Java highlight=3 showlineno=true
@Delete("/blogs/:id")
public void deleteBlogPost(@Param int id) {
  BlogPost removed = blogPosts.remove(id);
}
```

### Handle exceptions

What if there is no such post to delete? We can check if the blog exists before attempting to remove the blog post. Here, let's handle it after the attempt.

1. Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if no blog post exists with a given ID.

  ```java filename=BlogService.java
  @Delete("/blogs/:id")
  public void deleteBlogPost(@Param int id) {
    ...

    if (removed == null) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("The blog post does not exist. id: " + id);
    }
  }
  ```

2. Create an exception handler for the blog service:
   1. Create a file, BadRequestExceptionHandler.java.
   2. In the file, declare a custom exception handler implementing Armeria's <type://ExceptionHandlerFunction> interface.

   ```java filename=BadRequestExceptionHandler.java
   package example.armeria.server.blog;
   
   import com.linecorp.armeria.server.annotation.ExceptionHandlerFunction;
   import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
   
   public class BadRequestExceptionHandler implements ExceptionHandlerFunction {
     private static final ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
   }
   ```

3. Implement your own exception handler by overriding the default `handleException()` method. Add a code block for handling the `IllegalArgumentException` thrown. For this tutorial, return a BAD REQUEST as the response.

  ```java filename=BadRequesExceptionHandler.java highlight=11,15,17
  import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ObjectNode;
  import com.linecorp.armeria.common.HttpResponse;
  import com.linecorp.armeria.common.HttpStatus;
  import com.linecorp.armeria.server.ServiceRequestContext;

  public class BadRequestExceptionHandler implements ExceptionHandlerFunction {
    ...

    @Override
    public HttpResponse handleException(ServiceRequestContext ctx, HttpRequest req, Throwable cause) {
      if (cause instanceof IllegalArgumentException) {
          String message = cause.getMessage();
          ObjectNode objectNode = mapper.createObjectNode();
          objectNode.put("error", message);
          return HttpResponse.ofJson(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, objectNode);
      }
      return ExceptionHandlerFunction.fallthrough();
    }
  }
  ```

4. Assign the exception handler to the `deleteBlogPost()` method by annotating the `deletePost()` method with the <type://@ExceptionHandler> as follows.

  ```java filename=BlogService.java highlight=2
  import com.linecorp.armeria.server.annotation.ExceptionHandler;

  @Delete("/blogs/:id")
  @ExceptionHandler(BadRequestExceptionHandler.class)
  public void deleteBlogPost(@Param int id) { ... }
  ```

### Add blocking

With real services, accessing and operating on a database takes time. We need to hand over such blocking tasks to [blocking task executor](/docs/server-annotated-service#specifying-a-blocking-task-executor) so that the EventLoop isn't blocked. There are a few options to implement this; we'll annotate our service method with the <type://@Blocking>.

```java filename=BlogService.java highlight=6
import com.linecorp.armeria.server.annotation.Blocking;

public final class BlogService {
  ...

  @Blocking
  @Delete("/blogs/:id")
  @ExceptionHandler(BadRequestExceptionHandler.class)
  public void deleteBlogPost(@Param int id) { ... }
}
```

## 4. Return response

We've already handled returning the not found error in the [exception handling section](#handle-exceptions). Here, we'll return a response for successful deletion.

1. Replace the return type of the `deleteBlogPost()` method from `void` to <type://HttpResponse>.
2. Return a response using Armeria's <type://HttpResponse>, containing <type://HttpStatus#NO_CONTENT>.

```java filename=BlogService.java highlight=9,11
import com.linecorp.armeria.common.HttpResponse;

public final class BlogService {
  ...

  @Blocking
  @Delete("/blogs/:id")
  @ExceptionHandler(BadRequestExceptionHandler.class)
  public HttpResponse deleteBlogPost(@Param int id) {
    ...
    return HttpResponse.of(HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT);
  }
}
```

## 5. Test deleting a blog post

Let's test deleting a blog post.

1. Run the server like we did in [Step 1. Create a server](/tutorials/rest/blog/create-server) by running the `main()` method or using Gradle. When you see the message, "Server has been started", you can try testing service methods.
2. Create a couple of blog posts to test deleting a blog post and get the ID value returned. Enter the cURL commands below.

  ```bash
  $ curl --request POST 'localhost:8080/blogs' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"First post for testing", "content":"Test deletion."}'
  ```

  ```bash
  $ curl --request POST 'localhost:8080/blogs' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"Second post for testing", "content":"Test deleting a post."}'
  ```

  For each command, you'll get a response similar to the following.

  ```bash
  {"id":0,"title":"First post for testing","content":"Test deletion.","createdAt":...,"modifiedAt":...}

  {"id":1,"title":"Second post for testing","content":"Test deleting a post.","createdAt":...,"modifiedAt":...}
  ```

3. Let's delete the second blog with the ID, `0`. Since our service method doesn't return anything, you won't see any response.

  ```bash
  $ curl --request DELETE 'localhost:8080/blogs/0'
  ```

4. Let's retrieve the blog post list to see if the post has been deleted successfully.

  ```bash
  $ curl --request GET 'localhost:8080/blogs'
  ```

  The response contains only one blog post. We can tell that the blog post with the ID `0` has been removed.

  ```bash
  {"id":1,"title":"Second post for testing","content":"Test deleting a post.","createdAt":...,"modifiedAt":...}
  ```
You can test this also with Armeria's [Documentation service](/docs/server-docservice). See [Using DocService after adding service methods](/tutorials/rest/blog/add-services-to-server#using-docservice-after-adding-service-methods) for instructions.

## Next step

In this step, we've written a method for a DELETE operation and used Armeria's annotations; <type://@Delete>, <type://@Param>, <type://@ExceptionHandler> and <type://@Blocking>.

We've come to the end of this tutorial. Next, try adding more service methods to the tutorial or have a go at developing a service of your own.
