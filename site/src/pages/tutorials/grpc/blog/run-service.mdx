# Test running a service

In this step, we'll do three things with the code we obtained from our proto file; we'll create a server instance, add an empty gRPC service, and then lastly create a minimal client.

<TutorialSteps current={2} />

## What you need

You need to have the [Java code generated](/tutorials/grpc/blog/define-service#compile-proto-file) from the service and messages defined in the [proto file](/tutorials/grpc/blog/define-service).

## 1. Declare an empty service

Create a file `BlogService.java` and declare an empty blog service. We'll implement the service methods later on in this file. For now, leave it empty.

```java filename=BlogService.java
package example.armeria.blog.grpc;

final class BlogService extends BlogServiceGrpc.BlogServiceImplBase {}
```

## 2. Add a service to a server

Build a service and server using Armeria's <type://ServerBuilder> to serve our service.

1. Create a main class for our server. You can see the full version of the file [here](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/blob/main/tutorials/grpc/src/main/java/example/armeria/server/blog/grpc/BlogService.java).

  ```java filename=Main.java
  package example.armeria.blog.grpc;

  import org.slf4j.Logger;
  import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

  public final class Main {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);
  }
  ```
2. Create a service instance using Armeria's <type://GrpcService#builder()>.
  ```java filename=Main.java
  import com.linecorp.armeria.server.grpc.GrpcService;

  public final class Main {
    static Server newServer(int port) throws Exception {
      final GrpcService grpcService = 
        GrpcService.builder()
                   .addService(new BlogService())
                   .build();
    }
  }
  ```
3. Build and return a new server instance using Armeria's <type://ServerBuilder>.
  ```java filename=Main.java
    public final class Main {
      static Server newServer(int port) throws Exception {
        ...
        return Server.builder()
                     .http(port)
                     .service(grpcService)
                     .build();

      }
  ```

## 3. Serve the service

Create a server instance and run the blog service.

1. Create a server instance in the `main()` method.
  ```java filename=Main.java
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
      final Server server = newServer(8080);

      server.closeOnJvmShutdown().thenRun(() -> {
          logger.info("Server has been stopped.");
      });

      server.start().join();
  }
  ```
2. Start the server by running the `Main.main()` method on your IDE or using Gradle.
  ```bash
  ./gradlew run
  ```
3. Open up http://127.0.0.1:8080 on a web browser. Since our blog service is empty, you'll see the 404 "Not Found" message in the browser. At least we've checked that we got our service to run on a server.

## 4. Write a client

We've only tested running the service on a server. This time, let's try calling the service. To test, we'll write a simple client using Armeria's <type://GrpcClients#newClient(String,Class)> and the Java code generated from [Defining a service](/tutorials/grpc/blog/define-service).

1. Create another main class for the client. We'll name the file `BlogClient.java`.
  ```java filename=BlogClient.java
  package example.armeria.client.blog.grpc;

  final class BlogClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {}
  }
  ```
2. Create a client using Armeria's <type://GrpcClients>. We're running the server locally and have set the port to 8080 in our server code. Let's access the server at http://127.0.0.1:8080.
  ```java filename=BlogClient.java
  import com.linecorp.armeria.client.grpc.GrpcClients;
  import example.armeria.blog.grpc.BlogServiceGrpc.BlogServiceBlockingStub;

  class BlogClient {
    static BlogServiceBlockingStub client;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
      client = GrpcClients.newClient("http://127.0.0.1:8080/",
                                     BlogServiceBlockingStub.class);
  }
  ```
3. Although we haven't implemented any service methods, we'll call one just to check whether our client can communicate with the server.
  ```java filename=BlogClient.java
  import example.armeria.blog.grpc.Blog.BlogPost;
  import example.armeria.blog.grpc.Blog.CreateBlogPostRequest;

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    ...
    CreateBlogPostRequest request = CreateBlogPostRequest.newBuilder()
                                                         .setTitle("My first blog")
                                                         .setContent("Yay")
                                                         .build();
    BlogPost response = client.createBlogPost(request);
  }
  ```

## 5. Test run

While the server is running, run the client's `main()` method. You'll get an exception.

```bash
Exception in thread "main" io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException: UNIMPLEMENTED: Method example.armeria.blog.grpc.BlogService/CreateBlogPost is unimplemented
```

The message says "UNIMPLEMENTED". This is because we are yet to implement the service method to create a blog post. One thing we did check is that our service does return something to a client call.

## What's next

In this step, we've created and added an empty gRPC service to a server. We've also created a minimal client and made a call to the server.

Next, we'll get on with implementing a service method for [creating blog posts](/tutorials/grpc/blog/implement-create).
