# Running a service

In this step, we'll do three things with the code we obtained from our proto file; we'll create a server instance, add an empty gRPC service, and then lastly test connecting to the server.

<TutorialSteps current={2} />

## What you need

You need to have the [generated Java code](/tutorials/grpc/blog/define-service#6-compile-the-proto-file) obtained from the previous step.
You can always [download](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/tree/main/tutorials/grpc) the full version, instead of creating one yourself.

## 1. Declare an empty service

Create a file `BlogService.java` and declare an empty blog service. We'll implement the service methods later on in this file. For now, leave it empty.

```java filename=BlogService.java
package example.armeria.blog.grpc;

final class BlogService extends BlogServiceGrpc.BlogServiceImplBase {}
```

## 2. Add a service to a server

Build a service and server using Armeria's <type://ServerBuilder> to serve our service.

1. Create a main class for our server. You can see the full version of the file [here](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/blob/main/tutorials/grpc/src/main/java/example/armeria/server/blog/grpc/Main.java).

  ```java filename=Main.java
  package example.armeria.blog.grpc;

  import org.slf4j.Logger;
  import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

  public final class Main {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);
  }
  ```
2. Create a service instance using Armeria's <type://GrpcService#builder()>.
  ```java filename=Main.java
  import com.linecorp.armeria.server.grpc.GrpcService;
  import com.linecorp.armeria.server.Server;

  public final class Main {
  ...
    static Server newServer(int port) throws Exception {
      final GrpcService grpcService =
        GrpcService.builder()
                   .addService(new BlogService())
                   .build();
    }
  }
  ```
3. Build and return a new server instance using Armeria's <type://ServerBuilder>.
  ```java filename=Main.java
    public final class Main {
      static Server newServer(int port) throws Exception {
        ...
        return Server.builder()
                     .http(port)
                     .service(grpcService)
                     .build();

      }
  ```

## 3. Run the server and service

Create a server instance and run the blog service.

1. Create a server instance in the `main()` method.
  ```java filename=Main.java
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
      final Server server = newServer(8080);

      server.closeOnJvmShutdown().thenRun(() -> {
          logger.info("Server has been stopped.");
      });

      server.start().join();
  }
  ```
2. Start the server by running the `Main.main()` method on your IDE or using Gradle.
  ```bash
  ./gradlew run
  ```
  Your server is running if you see the following message.
  ```bash
  [armeria-boss-http-*:8080] INFO com.linecorp.armeria.server.Server - Serving HTTP at /[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0%0]:8080 - http://127.0.0.1:8080/
  ```

## 4. Test connecting to the server

Let's create test code and connect to the server by sending a request using a client stub.
Note that we'll use test code to verify what we implement along the way.

1. Create a file, `BlogServiceTest.java`, under `{project_root}/src/test/java/example/armeria/blog/grpc` as follows.
You can see the full version of the file [here](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/blob/main/tutorials/grpc/src/test/java/example/armeria/server/blog/grpc/BlogServiceTest.java).
  ```java filename=BlogServiceTest.java
  package example.armeria.blog.grpc;
  import example.armeria.blog.grpc.BlogServiceGrpc.BlogServiceBlockingStub;

  class BlogServiceTest {
    static BlogServiceBlockingStub client;
  }
  ```
2. In the `BlogServiceTest` class, add a test method as follows.
Although we haven't implemented any service methods, we'll call one just to check whether we can connect to the server.

  ```java filename=BlogServiceTest.java
  import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
  import com.linecorp.armeria.client.grpc.GrpcClients;

  @Test
  void connect() {
    client = GrpcClients.newClient("http://127.0.0.1:8080/",
                                   BlogServiceBlockingStub.class);
    client.createBlogPost(CreateBlogPostRequest.newBuilder().build());
  }
  ```
3. Make sure that your server is running.
  If you have not stopped the server, it should already be running.
  Otherwise, restart the server by running the `Main.main()` method.
4. Run the test case on your IDE or using Gradle.
  ```
  ./gradlew test
  ```
  Your client sent a request to the service successfully if the test fails and throws an "UNIMPLEMENTED" exception.

  ```bash
  UNIMPLEMENTED: Method example.armeria.blog.grpc.BlogService/CreateBlogPost is unimplemented
  ```

  This is because we are yet to implement the service method to create a blog post. One thing we did check is that our service does return something to a client call.

## What's next

In this step, we've created and added an empty gRPC service to a server. We've also written a test and made a call to the server.

Next, we'll get on with implementing a service method for [creating blog posts](/tutorials/grpc/blog/implement-create).
