# gRPC tutorial introduction

Learn to build a gRPC service with Armeria by writing a blog service in gRPC. This tutorial is based on a [sample service](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/tree/master/tutorials/grpc), a minimal blog service, with which you can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

To keep our focus on Armeria, this tutorial and the sample service use memory-based operations instead of using database.

Try writing a service yourself by following this tutorial or have a go at [running the sample service](#build-and-run-sample-service) right away.

## Assumptions

This tutorial assumes that you have:

- Experience in building services in Java
- Experience in Java frameworks for server-side programming
- Understanding of gRPC and experience in implementing gRPC services

## Prerequisites

To run and develop the sample service, set your computer with the requirements:

- JDK 11 or higher
- Gradle: Set your Gradle to compile Java with the [-parameters](/docs/setup/#configure--parameters-javac-option) option

## Build and run sample service

The sample service provides you implementations of CRUD operations with corresponding service methods. Have a go at running the sample gRPC service and see the outcome of this tutorial.
Using Armeria's [Documentation Service](/docs/server-docservice), you can see a server running, receiving requests and sending responses.

1. Download the code from [here](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/tree/master/tutorials/grpc).
2. Build the sample service using the Gradle Wrapper.
  ```bash
  $ ./gradlew build
  ```
3. Run the sample service again, using the Gradle Wrapper.
  ```bash
  $ ./gradlew run
  ```
4. Open the Documentation service page on your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs.

## Try writing blog service yourself

Have a go at writing the blog service yourself, starting with [defining the service](/tutorials/grpc/blog/define-service). Use the sample service's build.gradle if you intend to start building the service from scracth.

<CodeBlock language="groovy" filename="build.gradle">{`
apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'idea'
apply plugin: 'eclipse'\n
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}\n
dependencies {
  implementation "com.linecorp.armeria:armeria:${versions['com.linecorp.armeria:armeria-bom']}"\n
  // Logging
  runtimeOnly 'ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:${versions['ch.qos.logback:logback-classic']}'
  runtimeOnly 'org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j:${versions['org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j']}'
}
`}</CodeBlock>
