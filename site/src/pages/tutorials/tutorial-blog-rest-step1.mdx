# Creating a server

As the first step of the tutorial, we create a server instance and run a dummy service to check that the server and service are launched.
We will use Armeria's <type://ServerBuilder> for this task.

<TutorialSteps current={1} />

## What you need

You don't need to prepare anything at this stage.
Just check that you have prepared the [prerequisites](./tutorial-blog-rest-intro/#prerequisites).

## 1. Create the main class

Start by creating a main class:

1. Create a Java file named Main. For the full version of the file, check the [service sample code](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/blob/master/rest-api-annotated-service/src/main/java/example/armeria/server/blog/Main.java).
2. Add required import statements.
3. Declare a class, `Main`.
4. (Optional) Add a logger in the class for logging messages.

```java filename=Main.java
package example.armeria.server.blog;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import com.linecorp.armeria.common.HttpResponse;
import com.linecorp.armeria.server.Server;
import com.linecorp.armeria.server.ServerBuilder;

public final class Main {
  private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);
}
```

## 2. Create a server instance

To create a server instance, use Armeria's <type://ServerBuilder>. Add the method, `newServer()` in the `Main` class. Since server instances require at least one service to run with, add a dummy service returning `"Hello, Armeria!"` for the mere purpose of checking that the server gets launched and runs.

```java filename=Main.java highlight=6,7
static Server newServer(int port) {
  final ServerBuilder sb = Server.builder();
  final DocService docService = DocService.builder()
                                          .build();
  return sb.http(port)
            .service("/",(ctx, req) ->
                HttpResponse.of("Hello, Armeria!"))
            .build();
}
```

Later on, when we build our blog service, we will come back to this part of the code to [add an actual service](./tutorial-blog-rest-step7).

## 3. Start the server

Add the code to start the server with the dummy service.

1. In the `Main` class, add the `main()` method.
2. Call the `newServer()` method we implemented in step 2. Let's set the port to `8080` as in line 2.
3. Start the server as in line 9.

```java filename=Main.java highlight=2,9
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  final Server server = newServer(8080);

  Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> {
      server.stop().join();
      logger.info("Server has been stopped.");
  }));

  server.start().join();

  logger.info("Server has been started. Serving dummy service at http://127.0.0.1:{}",
              server.activeLocalPort());
}
```

## 4. Run the server and service

As the last step, launch the server and run the service to check if you are all set to go. To run the server, run the `main()` method in your IDE. The server and service are launched successfully if you see the following message.


```bash
 Server has been started. Serving dummy service at http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Open the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8080` on a web browser and check the message `Hello, Armeria!` is displayed in the page.

## What's next

In this step, you've built a server, added a dummy service and launched a server.

Next, at [Step 2. Prepare data object](./tutorial-blog-rest-step2), you will write a data object to specify and contain blog post information.
