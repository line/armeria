# v1.26.2

## 🛠️ Bug fixes

- Armeria now reuses the connections more efficiently when [RetryingClient](type) is used in conjunction
  with client-side load-balancing. Previously, an excessive number of connections were created when
  requests are retried. #5290
- You no longer see an [EndpointSelectionTimeoutException](type) when selecting an [Endpoint](type) from an
  [EndpointGroup](type). #5281
- Fixed a bug where Armeria Spring Boot integration is not compatible with Spring Boot 2.6 and earlier. #5279
