# Automatic retry

When a client gets an error response, it might want to retry the request depending on the response.
This can be accomplished using a [decorator](/docs/client-decorator), and Armeria provides the following
implementations out-of-the box.
- <type://RetryingClient>
- <type://RetryingRpcClient>

Both behave the same except for the different request and response types.
So, let's find out what we can do with <type://RetryingClient>.

## `RetryingClient`

You can just use the `decorator()` method in <type://ClientBuilder> or <type://WebClientBuilder> to build a
<type://RetryingClient>. For example:

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.WebClient;
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.retry.RetryingClient;
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.retry.RetryRule;
import com.linecorp.armeria.common.AggregatedHttpResponse;

RetryRule rule = RetryRule.failsafe();
WebClient client = WebClient.builder("http://example.com/hello")
                            .decorator(RetryingClient.newDecorator(rule))
                            .build();

AggregatedHttpResponse res = client.execute(...).aggregate().join();
```

That's it. The client will keep attempting until it succeeds or the number of attempts exceeds the maximum
number of total attempts. You can configure the `maxTotalAttempts` when making the decorator using
<type://RetryingClient#newDecorator(RetryRule,int)>. Meanwhile, the `rule` will decide to
retry depending on the response. In this case, the client retries when it receives `5xx` response error or
an exception is raised.

## `RetryRule`

You can fluently build your own :api:`RetryRule`.

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.ResponseTimeoutException;
import com.linecorp.armeria.common.HttpStatus;

Backoff myBackoff = ...;
RetryRule.of(RetryRule.builder().onUnProcessed().thenBackoff(myBackoff),
             RetryRule.builder().onException(ResponseTimeoutException.class).thenBackoff(),
             RetryRule.builder().onStatus(HttpStatus.TOO_MANY_REQUESTS).thenNoRetry())
```

Or you can customize the **rule** by implementing :api:`RetryRule`.

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.ClientRequestContext;
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.UnprocessedRequestException;
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.retry.Backoff;
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.retry.RetryDecision;

new RetryRule() {
    Backoff backoff = Backoff.ofDefault();

    @Override
    public CompletionStage<RetryDecision> shouldRetry(ClientRequestContext ctx,
                                                      @Nullable Throwable cause) {
        if (cause != null) {
            if (cause instanceof ResponseTimeoutException ||
                cause instanceof UnprocessedRequestException) {
                // The response timed out or the request has not been handled
                // by the server.
                return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(RetryDecision.retry(backoff));
            }
        }

        if (ctx.log().responseHeaders().status() == HttpStatus.TOO_MANY_REQUESTS) {
            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(RetryDecision.stop());
        }

        // Return 'next()' to lookup other rules.
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(RetryDecision.next());
    }
};
```

This will retry when one of <type://ResponseTimeoutException> and <type://UnprocessedRequestException> is raised
or the response's status is `429 Too Many Requests`.

<Warning>

We declare a <type://Backoff> as a member and reuse it when a `rule` returns it, so that we do not
return a different <type://Backoff> instance for each `shouldRetry()`. <type://RetryingClient>
internally tracks the reference of the returned <type://Backoff> and increases the counter that keeps
the number of attempts made so far, and resets it to 0 when the <type://Backoff> returned by the retry rule
is not the same as before. Therefore, it is important to return the same <type://Backoff> instance unless
you decided to change your <type://Backoff> strategy. If you do not return the same one, when the
<type://Backoff> yields a different delay based on the number of retries, such as an exponential backoff,
it will not work as expected. We will take a close look into a <type://Backoff> at the next section.

</Warning>

<Tip>

<type://UnprocessedRequestException> literally means that the request has not been processed by the server.
Therefore, you can safely retry the request without worrying about the idempotency of the request.
For more information about idempotency, please refer to
[What are idempotent and/or safe methods?](http://restcookbook.com/HTTP%20Methods/idempotency/).

</Tip>

You can return a different <type://Backoff> according to the response status.

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.common.HttpStatusClass;

Backoff backoffOnServerErrorOrTimeout = Backoff.ofDefault();
Backoff backoffOnConflict = Backoff.fixed(100);
RetryRule.builder()
         .onException(ex -> ex instanceof ResponseTimeoutException ||
                            ex instanceof UnprocessedRequestException)
         .thenBackoff(backoffOnServerErrorOrTimeout)
         .orElse(RetryRule.builder()
                          .onStatusClass(HttpStatusClass.SERVER_ERROR)
                          .thenBackoff(backoffOnServerErrorOrTimeout))
         .orElse(RetryRule.builder()
                          .onStatus(HttpStatus.CONFLICT)
                          .thenBackoff(backoffOnConflict));
```

If you need to determine whether you need to retry by looking into the response content, you should implement
<type://RetryRuleWithContent> and specify it when you create a <type://WebClient>
using <type://RetryingClientBuilder>:

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.retry.RetryRuleWithContent;

RetryRuleWithContent<HttpResponse> retryRule =
        RetryRuleWithContent
                .<HttpResponse>builder()
                .onException(ex -> ex instanceof ResponseTimeoutException ||
                                   ex instanceof UnprocessedRequestException)
                .onResponse(response -> {
                    return response.aggregate()
                                   .thenApply(content -> "Should I retry?".equals(content.contentUtf8()));
                })
                .thenBackoff(backoff);

// Create a WebClient with a retry rule.
WebClient client = WebClient
        .builder(...)
        .decorator(RetryingClient.builder(retryRule)
                                 .newDecorator())
        .build();

AggregatedHttpResponse res = client.execute(...).aggregate().join();
```

<Tip>

You might find the <type://Exceptions#peel(Throwable)> method useful when the exception you are trying to
handle is wrapped by exceptions like `CompletionException` and `ExecutionException`:

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.common.Exceptions;

@Override
public CompletionStage<RetryDecision> shouldRetry(ClientRequestContext ctx,
                                                  @Nullable Throwable cause) {
    if (cause != null) {
        if (cause instanceof ResponseTimeoutException ||
            cause instanceof UnprocessedRequestException) {
            // The response timed out or the request has not been handled
            // by the server.
            return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(backoff);
        }

        Throwable peeled = Exceptions.peel(cause);
        if (peeled instanceof MyException) { ... }
    }
    ...
}
```

</Tip>

## `Backoff`

You can use a <type://Backoff> to determine the delay between attempts. Armeria provides <type://Backoff>
implementations which produce the following delays out of the box:
- Fixed delay, created with <type://Backoff#fixed(long)>
- Random delay, created with <type://Backoff#random(long,long)>
- Exponential delay which is multiplied on each attempt, created with <type://Backoff#exponential(long,long)>

Armeria provides <type://Backoff#ofDefault()> that you might use by default. It is exactly the same as:

```java
Backoff.exponential(200   /* minDelayMillis */,
                    10000 /* maxDelayMillis */,
                    2.0   /* multiplier     */)
       .withJitter(0.2 /* jitterRate */);
```

The delay starts from `minDelayMillis` until it reaches `maxDelayMillis` multiplying by multiplier every
retry. Please note that the <type://Backoff#withJitter(double)> will add jitter value to the calculated delay.

For more information, please refer to the API documentation of the
[com.linecorp.armeria.client.retry](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.linecorp.armeria/armeria-javadoc/latest/com/linecorp/armeria/client/retry/package-summary.html) package.

## `maxTotalAttempts` vs per-Backoff `maxAttempts`

If you create a <type://Backoff> using <type://Backoff#withMaxAttempts(int)> in a <type://RetryRule>,
the <type://RetryingClient> which uses the <type://RetryRule> will stop retrying when the number of
attempts passed `maxAttempts`. However, if you have more than one <type://Backoff> and return one after
the other continuously, it will keep retrying over and over again because the counter that
<type://RetryingClient> internally tracks is initialized every time the different <type://Backoff> is
returned. To limit the number of attempts in a whole retry session, <type://RetryingClient> limits
the maximum number of total attempts to 10 by default. You can change this value by specifying
`maxTotalAttempts` when you build a <type://RetryingClient>:

```java
RetryingClient.newDecorator(rule, maxTotalAttempts);
```

Or, you can override the default value of 10 using the JVM system property
`-Dcom.linecorp.armeria.defaultMaxTotalAttempts=<integer>`.

Note that when a <type://RetryingClient> stops due to the attempts limit, the client will get the last received
<type://Response> from the server.

## Per-attempt timeout

<type://ResponseTimeoutException> can occur in two different situations while retrying. First, it occurs
when the time of whole retry session has passed the time previously configured using:

```java
ClientBuilder.responseTimeoutMillis(millis);
// or..
ClientRequestContext.setResponseTimeoutAfterMillis(millis);
```

You cannot retry on this <type://ResponseTimeoutException>.
Second, it occurs when the time of individual attempt in retry has passed the time which is per-attempt timeout.
You can configure it when you create the decorator:

```java
RetryingClient.newDecorator(rule, maxTotalAttempts,
                            responseTimeoutMillisForEachAttempt);
```

You can retry on this <type://ResponseTimeoutException>.

For example, when making a retrying request to an unresponsive service
with `responseTimeoutMillis = 10,000`, `responseTimeoutMillisForEachAttempt = 3,000` and disabled
<type://Backoff>, the first three attempts will be timed out by the per-attempt timeout (3,000ms).
The 4th one will be aborted after 1,000ms since the request session has reached at 10,000ms before
it is timed out by the per-attempt timeout.

```bob-svg
0ms         3,000ms     6,000ms     9,000ms
|           |           |           |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+----+
| Attempt 1 | Attempt 2 | Attempt 3 | A4 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+----+
                                         |
                                       10,000ms (ResponseTimeoutException)
```

In the example above, every attempt is made before it is timed out because the <type://Backoff> is disabled.
However, what if a <type://Backoff> is enabled and the moment of trying next attempt is after the point of
<type://ResponseTimeoutException>? In such a case, the <type://RetryingClient> does not schedule for the
next attempt, but finishes the retry session immediately with the last received <type://Response>.
Consider the following example:

```bob-svg
0ms         3,000ms     6,000ms     9,000ms     12,000ms
|           |           |           |           |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------------------+
| Attempt 1 |           | Attempt 2 |           | Attempt 3 is not made |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+----+------+-----------------------+
                                    |    |
                                    | 10,000ms (retry session deadline)
                                    |
                                stops retrying at this point
```

Unlike the example above, the <type://Backoff> is enabled and it makes the <type://RetryingClient> perform
retries with 3-second delay. When the second attempt is finished at 9,000ms, the next attempt will be
at 12,000ms exceeding the response timeout of 10,000ms.
The <type://RetryingClient>, at this point, stops retrying and finished the retry session with the last
received <type://Response>, retrieved at 9,000ms from the attempt 2.

## `RetryingClient` with logging

You can use <type://RetryingClient> with <type://LoggingClient> to log. If you want to log all of the
requests and responses, decorate <type://LoggingClient> with <type://RetryingClient>. That is:

```java
RetryRule rule = RetryRule.failsafe();
WebClient client = WebClient.builder(...)
                            .decorator(LoggingClient.newDecorator())
                            .decorator(RetryingClient.newDecorator(rule))
                            .build();
```

This will produce following logs when there are three attempts:

```
Request: {startTime=..., length=..., duration=..., scheme=..., host=..., headers=[...]
Response: {startTime=..., length=..., duration=..., headers=[:status=500, ...]
Request: {startTime=..., ..., headers=[..., armeria-retry-count=1, ...]
Response: {startTime=..., length=..., duration=..., headers=[:status=500, ...]
Request: {startTime=..., ..., headers=[..., armeria-retry-count=2, ...]
Response: {startTime=..., length=..., duration=..., headers=[:status=200, ...]
```

<Tip>

Did you notice that the `armeria-retry-count` header is inserted from the second request?
<type://RetryingClient> inserts it to indicate the retry count of a request.
The server might use this value to reject excessive retries, etc.

</Tip>

If you want to log the first request and the last response, no matter if it's successful or not,
do the reverse:

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.logging.LoggingClient;

RetryRule rule = RetryRule.failsafe();
// Note the order of decoration.
WebClient client = WebClient.builder(...)
                            .decorator(RetryingClient.newDecorator(rule))
                            .decorator(LoggingClient.newDecorator())
                            .build();
```

This will produce single request and response log pair and the total number of attempts only, regardless
how many attempts are made:

```
Request: {startTime=..., length=..., duration=..., scheme=..., host=..., headers=[...]
Response: {startTime=..., length=..., headers=[:status=200, ...]}, {totalAttempts=3}
```

<Tip>

Please refer to [Nested log](/docs/advanced-structured-logging#nested-log),
if you are curious about how this works internally.

</Tip>

## `RetryingClient` with circuit breaker

You might want to use [Circuit breaker](/docs/client-circuit-breaker) with <type://RetryingClient> using
[Decorating a client](/docs/client-decorator):

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreakerRule;
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.circuitbreaker.CircuitBreakerClientBuilder;

CircuitBreakerRule cbRule = CircuitBreakerRule.onServerErrorStatus();
RetryRule myRetryRule = RetryRule.builder()
                                 ...
                                 .build();

WebClient client = WebClient.builder(...)
                            .decorator(CircuitBreakerClient.builder(cbRule)
                                                           .newDecorator())
                            .decorator(RetryingClient.builder(myRetryRule)
                                                     .newDecorator())
                            .build();

AggregatedHttpResponse res = client.execute(...).aggregate().join();
```

This decorates <type://CircuitBreakerClient> with <type://RetryingClient> so that the <type://CircuitBreaker>
judges every request and retried request as successful or failed. If the failure rate exceeds a certain
threshold, it raises a <type://FailFastException>. When using both clients, you need to build a custom
<type://RetryRule> to handle this exception so that the <type://RetryingClient> does not attempt
a retry unnecessarily when the circuit is open, e.g.

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.circuitbreaker.FailFastException;

RetryRule.of(RetryRule.builder()
                      // The circuit is already open so stops retrying.
                      .onException(FailFastException.class)
                      .thenNoRetry(),
             RetryRule.builder()
                      .onException(ex -> ex instanceof ResponseTimeoutException ||
                                         ex instanceof UnprocessedRequestException)
                      .thenBackoff(),
             // Implement the rest of your own rule.
             ...);
```

<Tip>

You may want to allow retrying even on <type://FailFastException> when your endpoint is configured with
client-side load balancing because the next attempt might be sent to the next available endpoint.
See [Client-side load balancing and service discovery](/docs/client-service-discovery)
for more information.
