## From the community

<div class="noBullet">

- ðŸŽ“ Try out this guided [tutorial](https://armeria.dev/tutorials/rest/blog) for REST Service! This super friendly and simple tutorial will guide you to make a blog service, with which you can create, read, update and delete blog posts. In particular, you'll be using these Armeria features:
  - Service annotations
  - Request converter
  - Parameter injection
  - Exception handler
  - Blocking task executor
- ðŸ¦¾ MSA(Microservices Architecture): Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger
  - In the session, @cnabro introduces how [Series On](https://serieson.naver.com/) migrated their monoliths into microservices using Armeria, gRPC, and GraphQL. He also mentions about how they monitored microservices using [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/) and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).
  - Here are the [Video](https://youtu.be/1TsGYR1dves) and [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/line_devday2021/msa-microservices-architecture-harder-better-faster-stronger) (also providing [Korean](https://youtu.be/95L-_82N1vg) and [Japanese](https://youtu.be/pXIdcgchvSU))
