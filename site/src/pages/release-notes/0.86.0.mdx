## New features

- The request body is injected automatically in annotated HTTP service when the parameter type is `byte[]`, `HttpData`, `String` or `CharSequence` regardless of the `content-type` header. #1584, #1745
- You can now create a curl command from the `DocService` using `COPY AS A CURL COMMAND` button. #196, #1747
- You can now build your gRPC service without depending on gRPC stubs by extending `AbstractUnsafeUnaryGrpcService`. This is for advanced users only. #1766
- You can now log available ciphers for TLS on startup by setting a system property: `-Dcom.linecorp.armeria.dumpOpenSslInfo=true`. #1777

## Improvements

- You can now use `HttpTracingClient` even when the client is used outside of Armeria server. #1767, #1768
- You can now get pooled HTTP decode responses. #1770

## Bug fixes

- `RequestLogAvailabilityException` is no longer raised in `HttpTracling(Client|Service)` when a request timed out. #1769, #1775
- Now, an exception is raised while building a server when TLS is configured but ALPN is not supported. #1772, #1774
- `:scheme` and `:authority` headers are set for every received request in the server. #1773, #1776

## Breaking change

- `newDecoder()` in `StreamDecoderFactory` now takes a `ByteBufAllocator`. #1770
