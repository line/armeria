/**
 * WebSocket status codes specified in RFC-6455.
 * <pre>
 *
 * RFC-6455 The WebSocket Protocol, December 2011:
 * <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1"
 *         >https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1</a>
 *
 * WebSocket Protocol Registries, April 2019:
 * <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xhtml#close-code-number"
 *         >https://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xhtml</a>
 *
 * 7.4.1.  Defined Status Codes
 *
 * Endpoints MAY use the following pre-defined status codes when sending
 * a Close frame.
 *
 * 1000
 *
 *    1000 indicates a normal closure, meaning that the purpose for
 *    which the connection was established has been fulfilled.
 *
 * 1001
 *
 *    1001 indicates that an endpoint is "going away", such as a server
 *    going down or a browser having navigated away from a page.
 *
 * 1002
 *
 *    1002 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection due
 *    to a protocol error.
 *
 * 1003
 *
 *    1003 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection
 *    because it has received a type of data it cannot accept (e.g., an
 *    endpoint that understands only text data MAY send this if it
 *    receives a binary message).
 *
 * 1004
 *
 *    Reserved. The specific meaning might be defined in the future.
 *
 * 1005
 *
 *    1005 is a reserved value and MUST NOT be set as a status code in a
 *    Close control frame by an endpoint. It is designated for use in
 *    applications expecting a status code to indicate that no status
 *    code was actually present.
 *
 * 1006
 *
 *    1006 is a reserved value and MUST NOT be set as a status code in a
 *    Close control frame by an endpoint. It is designated for use in
 *    applications expecting a status code to indicate that the
 *    connection was closed abnormally, e.g., without sending or
 *    receiving a Close control frame.
 *
 * 1007
 *
 *    1007 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection
 *    because it has received data within a message that was not
 *    consistent with the type of the message (e.g., non-UTF-8 [RFC3629]
 *    data within a text message).
 *
 * 1008
 *
 *    1008 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection
 *    because it has received a message that violates its policy. This
 *    is a generic status code that can be returned when there is no
 *    other more suitable status code (e.g., 1003 or 1009) or if there
 *    is a need to hide specific details about the policy.
 *
 * 1009
 *
 *    1009 indicates that an endpoint is terminating the connection
 *    because it has received a message that is too big for it to
 *    process.
 *
 * 1010
 *
 *    1010 indicates that an endpoint (client) is terminating the
 *    connection because it has expected the server to negotiate one or
 *    more extension, but the server didn't return them in the response
 *    message of the WebSocket handshake. The list of extensions that
 *    are needed SHOULD appear in the /reason/ part of the Close frame.
 *    Note that this status code is not used by the server, because it
 *    can fail the WebSocket handshake instead.
 *
 * 1011
 *
 *    1011 indicates that a server is terminating the connection because
 *    it encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from
 *    fulfilling the request.
 *
 * 1012 (IANA Registry, Non RFC-6455)
 *
 *    1012 indicates that the service is restarted. a client may reconnect,
 *    and if it choses to do, should reconnect using a randomized delay
 *    of 5 - 30 seconds.
 *
 * 1013 (IANA Registry, Non RFC-6455)
 *
 *    1013 indicates that the service is experiencing overload. a client
 *    should only connect to a different IP (when there are multiple for the
 *    target) or reconnect to the same IP upon user action.
 *
 * 1014 (IANA Registry, Non RFC-6455)
 *
 *    The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid
 *    response from the upstream server. This is similar to 502 HTTP Status Code.
 *
 * 1015
 *
 *    1015 is a reserved value and MUST NOT be set as a status code in a
 *    Close control frame by an endpoint. It is designated for use in
 *    applications expecting a status code to indicate that the
 *    connection was closed due to a failure to perform a TLS handshake
 *    (e.g., the server certificate can't be verified).
 *
 *
 * 7.4.2. Reserved Status Code Ranges
 *
 * 0-999
 *
 *    Status codes in the range 0-999 are not used.
 *
 * 1000-2999
 *
 *    Status codes in the range 1000-2999 are reserved for definition by
 *    this protocol, its future revisions, and extensions specified in a
 *    permanent and readily available public specification.
 *
 * 3000-3999
 *
 *    Status codes in the range 3000-3999 are reserved for use by
 *    libraries, frameworks, and applications. These status codes are
 *    registered directly with IANA. The interpretation of these codes
 *    is undefined by this protocol.
 *
 * 4000-4999
 *
 *    Status codes in the range 4000-4999 are reserved for private use
 *    and thus can't be registered. Such codes can be used by prior
 *    agreements between WebSocket applications. The interpretation of
 *    these codes is undefined by this protocol.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>While {@link WebSocketCloseStatus} is enum-like structure, its instances should NOT be compared
 * by reference.
 * Instead, either {@link #equals(Object)} should be used or direct comparison of {@link #code()} value.
