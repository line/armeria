# Using Armeria with Spring WebFlux

<Tip>

</Tip>

Spring framework provides powerful features which are necessary for building a web application, such as
dependency injection, data binding, AOP, transaction, etc. In addition, if your Spring application integrates
with Armeria, you can leverage the following:
- Rich support for Apache [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/) and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/),
  including [the fancy web console](/docs/server-docservice) that enables you to send Thrift and gRPC requests
  from a web browser
- Ability to run HTTP REST service and RPC service in the same port
- Full HTTP/2 support for both server-side and client-side, including `h2c` (plaintext HTTP/2)
- [PROXY protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) support which provides
  interoperability with load balancers such as [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) and
  [AWS ELB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)

Armeria can be plugged in as the underlying HTTP server for a Spring WebFlux application by adding
the following dependency:
- For Maven:

  <CodeBlock language="xml">{`
  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>com.linecorp.armeria</groupId>
        <artifactId>armeria-bom</artifactId>
        <version>${versions['com.linecorp.armeria:armeria-bom']}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>io.netty</groupId>
        <artifactId>netty-bom</artifactId>
        <version>${versions['io.netty:netty-bom']}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>\n
  <dependency>
      <groupId>com.linecorp.armeria</groupId>
      <artifactId>armeria-spring-boot-webflux-starter</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  `}</CodeBlock>

- For Gradle:

  <CodeBlock language="groovy">{`
  plugins {
      id "org.springframework.boot" version "${versions['org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter']}"
  }\n
  dependencyManagement {
      imports {
          mavenBom '${versions['com.linecorp.armeria:armeria-bom']}'
          mavenBom '${versions['io.netty:netty-bom']}'
      }
  }\n
  dependencies {
      compile 'com.linecorp.armeria:armeria-spring-boot-webflux-starter'
  }
  `}</CodeBlock>

The above starter configures Armeria as the HTTP server for WebFlux to run on by referring to `application.yml`
when the application starts up. A user can customize the server configuration with the same properties
provided by Spring Boot as for other servers supported with WebFlux such as Tomcat or Reactor Netty.
The following is a simple example for configuring the server:

```yaml
server:
  address: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
```

For a user who wants to customize the web server, <type://ArmeriaServerConfigurator> is provided.
The user can customize the server by defining a bean of the type in the configuration as follows:

```java
@Configuration
public class ArmeriaConfiguration {
    // A user can configure the server by providing an ArmeriaServerConfigurator bean.
    @Bean
    public ArmeriaServerConfigurator armeriaServerConfigurator() {
        // Customize the server using the given ServerBuilder. For example:
        return builder -> {
            // Add DocService that enables you to send Thrift and gRPC requests
            // from web browser.
            builder.serviceUnder("/docs", new DocService());

            // Log every message which the server receives and responds.
            builder.decorator(LoggingService.newDecorator());

            // Write access log after completing a request.
            builder.accessLogWriter(AccessLogWriter.combined(), false);

            // You can also bind asynchronous RPC services such as Thrift and gRPC:
            // builder.service(THttpService.of(...));
            // builder.service(GrpcService.builder()...build());
        };
    }
}
```

Armeria can also be plugged as the underlying HTTP client for the Spring `WebClient`. To customize
client settings for the Armeria HTTP client, simply define an <type://ArmeriaClientConfigurator> bean
in your configuration as follows:

```java
@Configuration
public class ArmeriaConfiguration {
    // Returns a custom ClientFactory with TLS certificate validation disabled,
    // which means any certificate received from the server will be accepted
    // without any verification. It is used for an example which makes the client
    // send an HTTPS request to the server running on localhost with a self-signed
    // certificate. Do NOT use ClientFactory.insecure() or
    // ClientFactoryBuilder.tlsNoVerify() in production.
    @Bean
    public ClientFactory clientFactory() {
        return ClientFactory.insecure();
    }

    // A user can configure a Client by providing an ArmeriaClientConfigurator bean.
    @Bean
    public ArmeriaClientConfigurator
            armeriaClientConfigurator(ClientFactory clientFactory) {

        // Customize the client using the given WebClientBuilder. For example:
        return builder -> {
            // Use a circuit breaker for each remote host.
            final CircuitBreakerStrategy strategy =
                    CircuitBreakerStrategy.onServerErrorStatus();
            builder.decorator(CircuitBreakerClient.builder(strategy)
                                                  .newDecorator());

            // Set a custom client factory.
            builder.factory(clientFactory);
        };
    }
}
```
