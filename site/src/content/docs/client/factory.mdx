# Customizing a `ClientFactory` with `ClientFactoryBuilder`

A [ClientFactory](type) manages connections and protocol-specific properties.
You can customize the properties via [ClientFactoryBuilder](type). For example,
let's say that you want to increase the connection timeout.

```java
ClientFactory factory =
  ClientFactory
    .builder()
    // Increase the connection timeout to 5 seconds.
    .connectTimeoutMillis(5000)
    .build());
WebClient client =
  WebClient
   .builder("https://armeria.dev")
   .factory(factory)
   .build();
client.get("/api").aggregate().join();
```

The client created with the given [ClientFactory](type) will respect the settings such as connection timeout
that you defined.
You might notice that the clients, which are created using the same [ClientFactory](type),
share one connection pool. If you don't want to share the connections among the clients,
you should use different [ClientFactory](typeplural).
For the complete list of properties, see [ClientFactoryBuilder](type).

You might want to take a look at [ClientBuilder](type) to distinguish the client-specific properties.

You can also use [ClientFactoryOptions](type) to build [ClientFactory](type).
It's more verbose than calling a dedicated setter method, but it can be useful when you need to
set a series of options programmatically.

## Customizing TLS

You can configure the client authentication
for [mutual TLS (mTLS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/)
using [ClientFactoryBuilder#tls(InputStream,InputStream)](type) .
Additionally, you can specify various options such as a different CA certificate chain or enforce certain
cipher suites with [ClientFactoryBuilder#tlsCustomizer(Consumer)](type) .

```java
try (InputStream keyCertChainInputStream = ...;
     InputStream keyInputStream = ...) {
  ClientFactory factory =
    ClientFactory
      .builder()
      .tls(keyCertChainInputStream, keyInputStream)
      .build();
  WebClient
    .builder()
    .factory(factory)
    .build();
}
```

## Lifecycle of `ClientFactory`

Most clients for a [ClientFactory](type) need to send requests to another server for the lifetime of an application.
Therefore, you will generally avoid closing the [ClientFactory](type), except for perhaps in a shutdown hook,
to avoid losing any connection to the other servers.
For unit tests where a [ClientFactory](type) is only used for a single test or test class,
it is appropriate to close it when done using it.

## Specifying Netty `ChannelOption`s

You can also specify Netty [`ChannelOption`](https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/channel/ChannelOption.html)
via [ClientFactoryBuilder#channelOption(ChannelOption,T)](type):

```java
ClientFactory factory =
  ClientFactory
    .builder()
    // Set the size of send socket buffer as 4096 bytes
    .channelOption(ChannelOption.SO_SNDBUF, 4096)
    .build();
WebClient
  .builder()
  .factory(factory)
  .build();
```

## Specifying different `EventLoop` threads for different endpoints

By default, Armeria keeps at most 1 connection per endpoint (host and port pair) when using HTTP/2,
which is desirable for typical HTTP/2 services. Armeria achieves this by assigning one `EventLoop` per endpoint
from the [ServerConfig#workerGroup()](type). However, there's a limit to the requests that
a single connection(or `EventLoop` which is a thread) can handle, so you might want to increase
the number of connections(or `EventLoop` threads) for certain or all endpoints.

You can do this via [ClientFactoryBuilder#maxNumEventLoopsPerEndpoint(int)](type):

```java
ClientFactory factory =
  ClientFactory
    .builder()
    // A client will use maximum 5 EventLoops from the worker group per endpoint
    .maxNumEventLoopsPerEndpoint(5)
    .build();
WebClient
  .builder()
  .factory(factory)
  .build();

ClientFactory factory =
  ClientFactory
    .builder()
    // or you can just use Integer.MAX_VALUE to use all EventLoops
    .maxNumEventLoopsPerEndpoint(Integer.MAX_VALUE)
    .build();
WebClient
  .builder()
  .factory(factory)
  .build();

ClientFactory factory =
  ClientFactory
    .builder()
    // A client will use maximum 5 EventLoops per HTTP/1.1 endpoint
    .maxNumEventLoopsPerHttp1Endpoint(5)
    .build();
```

The client might need to send many requests to a certain endpoint, while sending small number of requests to others.
In that situation, you can use [ClientFactoryBuilder#maxNumEventLoopsFunction(ToIntFunction)](type):

```java
ClientFactory factory =
  ClientFactory
    .builder()
    .maxNumEventLoopsFunction(endpoint -> {
      if (endpoint.equals(Endpoint.of("lotsOfTraffic.com"))) {
        // We are going to use all EventLoops to send requests.
        return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
      }
      // We use just one `EventLoop` per endpoint for the rest.
      return 1;
    })
    .build();
WebClient
  .builder()
  .factory(factory)
  .build();
```
