## New features

- You can now send an HTTP request to an absolute URI, which means you don't need to create different `HttpClient`s for different hosts. #1143 #1343 #1961

  ```java
  HttpClient client = HttpClient.of(); // No base URI specified.
  client.get("http://foo.com").aggregate().join();
  client.execute(RequestHeaders.of(HttpMethod.GET, "http://bar.com")).aggregate().join();

  HttpClient client = HttpClient.of("http://baz.com"); // Base URI specified.
  client.get("/index.html").aggregate().join();
  client.get("http://qux.com").aggregate().join(); // Can override the base URI.
  ```

- `HealthCheckedEndpointGroup` has been revamped and now supports long-polling when used with Armeria's `HealthCheckService`. #1948 #1977 #1982
  - Long-polling support enables `HealthCheckedEndpointGroup` to detect the server health changes immediately with much fewer number of health check requests.
  - Long-polling support is auto-detected based on a special HTTP header `armeria-lphc`, so it is fully backward-compatible with ordinary non-Armeria health check services.
  ```java
  EndpointGroup group =
      HealthCheckedEndpointGroup.of(
          new StaticEndpointGroup(Endpoint.of("foo.com", 8080),
                                  Endpoint.of("bar.com", 8080)),
          "/internal/l7check");
  EndpointGroupRegistry.register("myGroup", group,
                                 EndpointSelectionStrategy.WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN);
  HttpClient client = HttpClient.of("http://group:myGroup");
  client.get("/").aggregate().join();
  ```
- You can now send a delayed response easily using `HttpResponse.delayed()`, which may be useful when simulating a slow server. #1935
  ```java
  Server server = new ServerBuilder()
      .service("/delayed", (ctx, req) -> HttpResponse.delayed(HttpResponse.of(200),
                                                              Duration.ofSeconds(3)))
      .build();
  ```
- You can now write a mock HTTP server using `MockWebServerExtension` and JUnit 5. #1884 #1935

  ```java
  class MyTest {
      @RegisterExtension
      static MockWebServerExtension server = new MockWebServerExtension();

      @Test
      void test() {
          server.enqueue(HttpResponse.of(200));
          HttpResponse actualRes = HttpClient.of(server.httpUri("/")).get("/");
          assertThat(actualRes.aggregate().join().status().code()).isEqualTo(200);
      }
  }
  ```

- `AsyncCloseable` has been added to provide an asynchronous close operation. #1948

  ```java
  public class IAmCloseable implements AutoCloseable, AsyncCloseable {
      @Override
      public CompletableFuture<?> closeAsync() {
          ...
      }

      @Override
      public void close() {
          closeAsync().join();
      }
  }
  ```

- You can now specify an `EventExecutor` when using `HttpResponse.from()`. #1937
- You can now suppress the false warnings from `RequestContextCurrentTraceContext` by using `setCurrentThreadNotRequestThread()` #1971 #1980

  - For example, you could prevent warnings from the administrative threads controlled by `ThreadFactory` like the following:

    ```java
    ThreadFactory factory = (runnable) -> new Thread(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            RequestContextCurrentTraceContext.setCurrentThreadNotRequestThread(true);
            runnable.run();
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return runnable.toString();
        }
    });
    ```

## Bug fixes

- `RequestLog.responseCause()` is now recorded correctly for client requests. #1977
- `RetryingClient` now respects the `Endpoint` selection order, which was broken since 0.89.0. #1973 #1974
- The health checked requests sent by `HealthCheckedEndpointGroup` are now sent at the correct interval, even if an endpoint is not responsive. #1948
- `ClosedPublisherException` is not raised anymore when `HttpResponse` is aborted by the client who issued the request. #1962
- Armeria gRPC client now sends the `TE` header, whose absence caused interoperability issues with some gRPC servers, such as Python gRPC server. #1963 #1965
- Armeria HTTP client does not send more than two `Host` headers for HTTP/1 anymore. #1942
- `HealthCheckedEndpointGroup` now waits until the initial `Endpoint`s are available from its delegate group. #1940

## Deprecations

- `HealthCheckedEndpointGroupBuilder.retryInterval()` has been un-deprecated. #1948
- `HealthCheckedEndpointGroupBuilder.healthCheckPort()` has been deprecated in favor of `port()`. #1948
- `CircuitBreakerBuilder.circuitBreakerMapping()` has been deprecated in favor of `mapping()`. #1970

## Breaking changes

- `HttpHealthCheckedEndpointGroup` has been renamed to `HealthCheckedEndpointGroup`.
  - The old `HealthCheckedEndpointGroup` has been renamed to `AbstractHealthCheckedEndpointGroup`, and is now extensible enough for you to implement your own health-checking mechanism, such as sending a gRPC/Thrift call.
