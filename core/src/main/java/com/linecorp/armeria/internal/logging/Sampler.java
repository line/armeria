/**
 * Sampler is responsible for deciding if a particular trace should be "sampled", i.e. whether the
 * overhead of tracing will occur and/or if a trace will be reported to the collection tier.
 *
 * <p>Zipkin v1 uses before-the-fact sampling. This means that the decision to keep or drop the
 * trace is made before any work is measured, or annotations are added. As such, the input parameter
 * to zipkin v1 samplers is the trace ID (64-bit random number).
 *
 * <p>The instrumentation sampling decision happens once, at the root of the trace, and is
 * propagated downstream. For this reason, the decision needn't be consistent based on trace ID.
