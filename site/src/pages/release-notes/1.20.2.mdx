## 🛠️ Bug fixes

- You no longer see `StacklessClosedChannelException` when an incoming HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 request has
  a `Connection: close` header. #4508
- Armeria doesn't send a bad response with non-empty body anymore when a service's <type://ExchangeType> is
  <type://ExchangeType#UNARY> and the service generates non-empty body for a HEAD request. #4512
- An <type://HttpRequest> is not failed with <type://AbortedStreamException> anymore
  when an <type://HttpResponse> is correctly sent. #4494
- <type://DocService> is correctly generated for a decorated <type://GrpcService> when
  [HTTP/JSON to GRPC transcoding](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/transcoding) is enabled. #4490
