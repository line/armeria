## New features

- `ClientRequestContext.current()` and `ServiceRequestContext.current()` have been added so you don't need to downcast `RequestContext` to `ClientRequestContext` or `ServiceRequestContext`. It also makes sure the current context is client-side (or server-side), preventing a `ClassCastException`. #1869 #1872
  ```java
  ClientRequestContext cctx = ClientRequestContext.current();
  ServiceRequestContext sctx = ServiceRequestContext.current();
  ```
- `currentOrNull()` static method has been added to `(Client|Service)RequestContext`, which is similar to `current()` but returning `null` when there's no current context. #1872
  ```java
  // Before:
  RequestContext ctx = RequestContext.mapCurrent(Function.identity(), null);
  // After:
  ServiceRequestContext sctx = ServiceRequestContext.currentOrNull();
  ```
- You can now specify different `AccessLogWriter`s for different services. #1866
  ```java
  Server server = new ServerBuilder()
          .route().path("/svc1")
                  .accessLogWriter(accessLogWriterForService1, true)
                  .build(service1)
          .route().path("/svc2") // Will use the fallbackAccessLogWriter.
                  .build(service2)
          .accessLogWriter(fallbackAccessLogWriter, true)
          .build();
  ```
- The metrics of the `Executor` specified in `ServerBuilder.blockingTaskExecutor()` will be exposed under `executor{name=armeriaBlockingTaskExecutor}`. #1683 #1841
- Armeria client will send a DNS query via TCP when a DNS response is truncated due to UDP packet size limitation. #1873
- You can now specify health check request interval using a `Backoff`, which means you can have more flexible delay strategy such as adding jitter. #1846
  ```java
  HttpHealthCheckedEndpointGroup group = new HttpHealthCheckedEndpointGroup(...)
          .retryBackoff(Backoff.fixed(10000).withJitter(0.3))
          .build();
  ```
  - By default, `HealthCheckedEndpointGroup` will now add 20% jitter to the health check request interval.
- A new module `armeria-brave` has been added to replace the deprecated `armeria-zipkin`. #1840
  - The package name has been changed from `com.linecorp.armeria.{common,client,server}.tracing` to `com.linecorp.armeria.{common,client,server}.brave`.
  - `HttpTracingClient` and `HttpTracingService` have been renamed to `BraveClient` and `BraveService`.
- You can now retrieve the `retrofit2.Invocation` object associated with the current Retrofit call via `InvocationUtil.get(RequestLog)`, which can be useful when building a meter ID prefix. #1591 #1845
  ```java
  public class MyRetrofitMeterIdPrefixFunction implements MeterIdPrefixFunction {
      @Override
      public MeterIdPrefix apply(MeterRegistry registry, RequestLog log) {
          final Invocation invocation = InvocationUtil.getInvocation(log);
          final String service;
          final String method;
          if (invocation != null) {
              service = invocation.method().getDeclaringClass().getSimpleName();
              method = invocation.method().getName();
          } else {
              service = "unknown";
              method = log.method().name();
          }
          return new MeterIdPrefix("call", "service", service, "method", method);
      }
  }
  ```
  - We also added `RetrofitMeterIdPrefixFunction` which provides the sensible default `MeterIdPrefixFunction` for Retrofit calls.

## Improvements

- The content negotiation logic has been relaxed so that the server falls back to the service with less constraint when content negotiation fails. Previously, it was rejecting the request. #1860
- More exceptions are now wrapped by `UnprocessedRequestException` to indicate whether the request can be safely retried without worrying about sending the request more than once. #1653 #1848
  - Any exceptions that occurred during a connection attempt.
  - Any exceptions that occurred during acquiring an existing connection from a connection pool.
  - We also made `UnprocessedRequestException.getCause()` is non-null, so you do not need to worry about the case where there is no cause in `UnprocessedRequestException`.

## Bug fixes

- Server will now allow specifying a `@Default` annotation with `null` value. #1858 #1864
- The `DEBUG` level log message which occurs when a client sent an ill-formed `Accept` header is now easier to understand. #1849
- `THttpService` now handles `HttpStatusException` and `HttpResponseException` correctly, which means they will not be translated into a `200 OK` response that contains a `TApplicationException` anymore. For example, your Thrift clients will see `503 Service Unavailable` response when your service throws an `HttpStatusException.of(503)` rather than `200 OK`. #1839 #1867
- `DocService` debug form will validate the endpoint path properly now. #1856 #1857
- `RequestContextCurrentTraceContext` now calls `decorateScope()` when necessary. #1840
- Spring Web and WebFlux integration do not ignore the `ssl.keyAlias` property anymore. #1843 #1865
- You will not see an `ERROR` log message when a client sends a `HEAD` request to your Spring WebFlux endpoint. #1847 #1859

## Deprecations

- `HttpHealthCheckedEndpointGroupBuilder.retryInterval(Duration)` has been deprecated. Use `retryBackoff(Backoff)`. #1846
- Everything in `armeria-zipkin` has been deprecated. Use `armeria-brave`. #1840
