# Calling a Thrift service

Let's assume we have the following Thrift IDL, served at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello`, just like what we
used in [Running a Thrift service](/docs/server-thrift):

```protobuf
namespace java com.example.thrift.hello

service HelloService {
    string hello(1:string name)
}
```

Making a call starts from creating a client:

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.Clients;

HelloService.Iface helloService = Clients.newClient(
        "tbinary+http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello",
        HelloService.Iface.class); // or AsyncIface.class

String greeting = helloService.hello("Armerian World");
assert greeting.equals("Hello, Armerian World!");
```

Note that we added the serialization format of the call using the `+` operator in the scheme part of the URI.
Because we are calling a Thrift server, we should choose: `tbinary`, `tcompact`, `tjson` or `ttext`.

Since we specified `HelloService.Iface` as the client type, `Clients.newClient()` will return a synchronous
client implementation.  If we specified `HelloService.AsyncIface`, the calling code would have looked like
the following:

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.common.thrift.ThriftFuture;
import com.linecorp.armeria.common.util.CompletionActions;
import com.linecorp.armeria.client.Clients;

HelloService.AsyncIface helloService = Clients.newClient(
        "tbinary+http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello",
        HelloService.AsyncIface.class);

ThriftFuture<String> future = new ThriftFuture<String>();
helloService.hello("Armerian World", future);

future.thenAccept(response -> assert response.equals("Hello, Armerian World!"))
      .exceptionally(cause -> {
          cause.printStackTrace();
          return null;
      });

// You can also wait until the call is finished.
String reply = future.get();
```

The example above introduces a new class called <type://ThriftFuture>. It is a subtype of Java 8
CompletableFuture_ that implements Thrift [AsyncMethodCallback]. Once passed as a callback of an asynchronous
Thrift call, <type://ThriftFuture> will complete itself when the reply is received or the call
fails. You'll find it way more convenient to consume the reply than [AsyncMethodCallback] thanks to the rich set
of methods provided by [CompletableFuture].

You can also use the builder pattern for client construction:

```java
import com.linecorp.armeria.common.HttpRequest;
import com.linecorp.armeria.common.HttpResponse;

HelloService.Iface helloService =
    Clients.builder("tbinary+http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello")
           .responseTimeoutMillis(10000)
           .decorator(LoggingClient.newDecorator())
           .build(HelloService.Iface.class); // or AsyncIface.class

String greeting = helloService.hello("Armerian World");
assert greeting.equals("Hello, Armerian World!");
```

As you might have noticed already, we decorated the client using <type://LoggingClient>, which logs all
requests and responses. You might be interested in decorating a client using other decorators, for example
to gather metrics. Please also refer to <type://ClientBuilder> for more configuration options.
