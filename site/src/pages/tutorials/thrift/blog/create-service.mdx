# Creating a service

As the first step of the tutorial, we'll create a simple service with a dummy method in Thrift and implement the service in Java.

<TutorialSteps current={1} />

## What you need

No preparation is required for this step. Do check that you've prepared the [prerequisites](/tutorials/thrift/blog/#prerequisites).

## 1. Create a thrift file

Create a thrift file, `blog.thrift` in the `{project_root}/src/main/thrift` folder as follows.
In the thrift file, let's define the `BlogService` service with the `hello()` method.

```cpp filename=blog.thrift
namespace java example.armeria.blog.thrift

service BlogService {
  string hello()
}
```

<Tip>

See [Sample service structure](/tutorials/thrift/blog#sample-service-structure) for the overall folder structure.

</Tip>

## 2. Compile the thrift file

Compile the `blog.thrift` file to generate Java code.
You can refer to the full [build.gradle](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/tree/main/tutorials/thrift/build.gradle) file for generating code with [Gradle Thrift Plugin](https://github.com/jruyi/thrift-gradle-plugin).

```bash
./gradlew compileThrift
```

You'll see the generated Java code in the `{project_root}/build/generated-sources/thrift/gen-java/example/armeria/blog/thrift/` folder.

## 3. Implement the service

Now, let's implement the service in Java.

1. Create a file, `BlogServiceImpl.java`.
2. Declare the `BlogServiceImpl` class implementing the `BlogService` service we defined earlier in Thrift.
  ```java filename=BlogServiceImpl.java
  package example.armeria.server.blog.thrift;

  import example.armeria.blog.thrift.BlogService;

  public class BlogServiceImpl implements BlogService.AsyncIface {}
  ```
3. In the `BlogServiceImpl` class, override the `hello()` method, a dummy method for temporary use to test the connection between server and client.
  ```java filename=BlogServiceImpl.java
  import org.apache.thrift.async.AsyncMethodCallback;
  ...
  @Override
  public void hello(AsyncMethodCallback<String> resultHandler) {
    resultHandler.onComplete("Hello, Armeria!");
  }
  ```

<Tip>

Although here we implement the asynchronous interface `BlogService.AsyncIface`, note that implementing the synchronous interface `BlogService.Iface` isn't very different.
See [Running a Thrift service](/docs/server-thrift) for more information.

</Tip>

## What's next

In this step, we've created a simple service with a dummy method.

Next, at [Step 2. Run a server](/tutorials/thrift/blog/run-server), we'll create and run a server with the service we've created.
Also, we'll run a client to make a call to the service.
