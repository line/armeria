/**
 * This sampler is appropriate for low-traffic instrumentation (ex servers that each receive <100K
 * requests), or those who do not provision random trace ids. It is not appropriate for collectors
 * as the sampling decision isn't idempotent (consistent based on trace id).
 *
 * <h3>Implementation</h3>
 *
 * <p>This initializes a random bitset of size 100 (corresponding to 1% granularity). This means
 * that it is accurate in units of 100 traces. At runtime, this loops through the bitset, returning
 * the value according to a counter.
