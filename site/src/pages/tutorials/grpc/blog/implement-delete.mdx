# Implementing DELETE operation

So far, we've created, read, and updated a blog post. Now, let's implement 
and make a call to finally delete a blog post.

<TutorialSteps current={6} />

## What you need

You need to have the files obtained from previous steps:

- [Java code generated](/tutorials/grpc/blog/define-service#compile-proto-file)
- Main.java
- BlogService.java
- BlogClient.java

## 1. Implement service

Let's add a method for deleting a blog post in the BlogService.java file we've been working on.

1. Add a service method, `deleteBlogPost()`.
```java filename=BlogService.java
import example.armeria.server.blog.grpc.Blog.DeleteBlogPostRequest;

public class BlogService extends BlogServiceGrpc.BlogServiceImplBase {
  @Override
  public void deleteBlogPost(DeleteBlogPostRequest request, StreamObserver<Empty> responseObserver) {
    final BlogPost removed = blogPosts.remove(request.getId());
    if (removed == null) {
      responseObserver.onError(
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("The post with ID": " + "does not exist");
     } else {
        responseObserver.onNext(Empty.getDefaultInstance());
        responseObserver.onCompleted();
     }
 }
}
```
2. Add Armeria's <type://GrpcServiceBuilder>'s blocking task executor to make all gRPC methods executed in the blocking task executor's thread pool.
```java filename=Main.java
private static Server newServer(int port) throws Exception {
  final GrpcService grpcService =
          GrpcService.builder().addService(new BlogService())
                               .exceptionMapping(new GrpcExceptionHandler())
                               .useBlockingTaskExecutor(true)
                               .build();
}
```

## 2. Implement client

This time, let's use the first client instance we created, `client`. Add a 
method `deleteBlogPost()` to send a request to update a blog post.

```java filename=BlogClient.java
import example.armeria.server.blog.grpc.Blog.DeleteBlogPostRequest;

class BlogClient {
  static void deleteBlogPost(Integer id) {
    final DeleteBlogPostRequest request = DeleteBlogPostRequest.newBuilder().setId(id).build();
    try {
      client.deleteBlogPost(request);
    }
    catch(StatusRuntimeException statusException) { 
      // Handle exception
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Test run

Let's test deleting a blog. We know that our client creates a blog post by default when it's executed and that the ID of the first one is always `0`.

1. Call the delete method we just implemented followed by `listBlogPosts()` to see that no post with the ID 0 exists after deleting the post.
  ```java filename=BlogClient.java
  static void testRun(){
    createBlogPost("Second blog", "This is my second attempt");
    deleteBlogPost(0);
    listBlogPosts();
  }
  ```
2. If your server is not running, [re-run the server](/tutorials/grpc/blog/run-service#3-serve-the-service). Your server is running if you see the following message.
  ```bash
  [armeria-boss-http-*:8080] INFO com.linecorp.armeria.server.Server - Serving HTTP at /[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0]:8080 - http://127.0.0.1:8080/
  ```
3. Run the client. The number of blog posts in the log depends on how you have tested so far. Anyhow, since we are deleting the first post, you won't have a problem, unless you've deleted it already.
   ```bash
   [armeria-common-worker-nio-2-1] DEBUG c.l.a.client.logging.LoggingClient - [creqId=8573ef34, ... 
   [http://127.0.0.1:8080/example.armeria.server.blog.grpc.BlogService/ListBlogPosts#POST] 
   Response: ..., content=CompletableRpcResponse{blogs {
   id: 1
   ```
4. Now, while keeping the server running, run the client again, attempting to delete the post with the ID 1, which does not exist any longer.

   This time, we can't tell if the blog post was deleted or if an error has occurred. (Although we expect an error to occur.) This is because we haven't added anything in the exception block.
  ```java filename=BlogClient.java
    catch(StatusRuntimeException statusException) { 
      // Handle exception
    }
  ```
   Suppose we have no time and just want to know if an error has occurred. One way we can do is using the interceptor, again. So, change the client instance from `client` to `cb` in the `deleteBlogPost()` method and run the client again.

   ```java filename=BlogClient.java
   try {
     cb.deleteBlogPost(request);
   }
   ```
   
   Now you'll see the exception logged as the following.
   ```bash
   io.grpc.StatusException: NOT_FOUND: The blog post does not exist. ID: 100
   ```

## What's next

Here, we've implemented a service method and client method for deleting a blog post. In the [next section](/tutorials/grpc/blog/add-docservice), we'll add Armeria's [Documentation service](/docs/server-docservice) to our blog service.
