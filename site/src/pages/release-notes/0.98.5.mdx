## 🌟 New features

- You can now use `UUID` as a parameter in your annotated service. #2573 #2577
  ```java
  public class MyAnnotatedService {
      @Get("/user/by-uuid/{uuid}")
      public User findUserByUuid(@Param UUID uuid) { ... }
  }
  ```
- `LogLevel.OFF` and `LogLevel.log(Logger, String, Object...)` have been added. #2532

## 📈 Improvements

- `ClosedSessionException` and `ClosedStreamException` now have a specific cause or message to help you understand why a connection or a stream has been closed. #2580
- A once-per-thread warning message will now be logged, as well as throwing an exception, when a user pushes a context incorrectly. #2583
- Some common socket exceptions raised by annotated services are not logged anymore by default to reduce the amount of less useful log messages. #2572

## 🛠️ Bug fixes

- `ConcurrencyLimitingClient` does not fail with an 'illegal context' error under load anymore. #2579
- `RetryingClient` and `RetryingRpcClient` handles negative `System.nanoTime()` values correctly now. #2584
- Fixed a bug where `RetryingClient` and `RetryingRpcClient` do not complete a request when `RetryStrategy` or `RetryStrategyWithContent` throws an exception. #2581
- `EventLoopCheckingFuture` and its subtypes do not warn about blocking operation anymore when they are done already. #2564
