/**
 * An {@link HttpData} that is backed by a pooled {@link ByteBuf} for optimizing certain internal use cases. Not
 * for general use.
 *
 * <h3>What are pooled buffers?</h3>
 *
 * <p>The buffer backing a {@link PooledHttpData} is a pooled buffer - this means that it does not use normal
 * Java garbage collection, and instead uses manual memory management using a reference count, similar to
 * some constructs in languages like C++. Manual memory management is more fragile and not idiomatic in Java -
 * you should only use this class in performance-sensitive situations and after being ready to deal with these
 * very hard-to-debug issues.
 *
 * <p>You may interact with {@link PooledHttpData} when using objects that return pooled objects, such as
 * {@link PooledWebClient}. If you don't use such objects, you will never see a {@link PooledHttpData} and don't
 * need to read further.
 *
 * <h3>Impact of pooled buffers</h3>
 *
 * <p>Any time you receive a {@link PooledHttpData} it will have a single reference that must be released -
 * failure to release the reference will result in a memory leak and poor performance. You must make sure to do
 * this by calling {@link PooledHttpData#close()}, usually in a try-with-resources structure to avoid side
 * effects.
 *
 * <p>For example, <pre>{@code
 * PooledHttpResponse res = PooledHttpResponse.of(client.get("/"));
 * res.aggregateWithPooledObjects(ctx.alloc(), ctx.executor())
 *    .thenApply(aggResp -> {
 *        // try-with-resources here ensures the content is released
 *        // if it is a ByteBufHttpData, or otherwise is a no-op if it is not.
 *        try (PooledHttpData content = aggResp.content()) {
 *            if (!aggResp.status().equals(HttpStatus.OK)) {
 *                throw new IllegalStateException("Bad response");
 *            }
 *            try {
 *                return OBJECT_MAPPER.readValue(content.toInputStream(), Foo.class);
 *            } catch (IOException e) {
 *                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Bad JSON: " + content.toStringUtf8());
 *            }
 *        }
 *    });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>In this example, it is the initial {@code try (PooledHttpData content = ...} that ensures the data is
 * released. Calls to methods on {@link HttpData} will all work and can be called any number of times within
 * this block. If called after the block, or a manual call to {@link PooledHttpData#close()}, these methods will
 * fail or corrupt data.
 *
 * <h3>Even more advanced usage</h3>
 *
 * <p>In some cases, you may want to access the {@link ByteBuf} held by this {@link PooledHttpData}. This will
 * generally be used with a fallback to wrapping an unpooled {@link PooledHttpData}, e.g., <pre>{@code
 *
 * final ByteBuf buf;
 * if (data instanceof ByteBufHolder) {
 *     buf = ((ByteBufHolder) data).content();
 * } else {
 *     buf = Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(data.array());
 * }
 *
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Using a {@link ByteBuf} directly is very advanced and can open up much more complicated management of
 * reference count. You should only ever do this if you are very comfortable with Netty.
 *
 * <p>It is recommended to also read through <a href="https://netty.io/wiki/reference-counted-objects.html">
 * Reference counted objects</a> for more information on pooled objects.
