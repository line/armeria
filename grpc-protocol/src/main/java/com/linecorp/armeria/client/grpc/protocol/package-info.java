/**
 * Unary gRPC client without support for gRPC generated code stubs. This package is separated for advanced
 * users that would like to use the gRPC wire protocol without depending on gRPC itself.
 * This package must not depend on any dependencies outside of {@code armeria-core}.
 *
 * <p>Don't use this package unless you know what you're doing, it is generally recommended to use a normal
 * gRPC client provided by the {@code armeria-grpc} module.</p>
 *
 * <p>The classes in this package, unlike other packages, are not guaranteed to be backward compatible since
 * it's an advanced API.</p>
