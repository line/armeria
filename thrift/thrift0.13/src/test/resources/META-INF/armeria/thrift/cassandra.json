      "doc": "The ConsistencyLevel is an enum that controls both read and write\nbehavior based on the ReplicationFactor of the keyspace.  The\ndifferent consistency levels have different meanings, depending on\nif you're doing a write or read operation.\n\nIf W + R > ReplicationFactor, where W is the number of nodes to\nblock for on write, and R the number to block for on reads, you\nwill have strongly consistent behavior; that is, readers will\nalways see the most recent write. Of these, the most interesting is\nto do QUORUM reads and writes, which gives you consistency while\nstill allowing availability in the face of node failures up to half\nof <ReplicationFactor>. Of course if latency is more important than\nconsistency then you can use lower values for either or both.\n\nSome ConsistencyLevels (ONE, TWO, THREE) refer to a specific number\nof replicas rather than a logical concept that adjusts\nautomatically with the replication factor.  Of these, only ONE is\ncommonly used; TWO and (even more rarely) THREE are only useful\nwhen you care more about guaranteeing a certain level of\ndurability, than consistency.\n\nWrite consistency levels make the following guarantees before reporting success to the client:\n  ANY          Ensure that the write has been written once somewhere, including possibly being hinted in a non-target node.\n  ONE          Ensure that the write has been written to at least 1 node's commit log and memory table\n  TWO          Ensure that the write has been written to at least 2 node's commit log and memory table\n  THREE        Ensure that the write has been written to at least 3 node's commit log and memory table\n  QUORUM       Ensure that the write has been written to <ReplicationFactor> \/ 2 + 1 nodes\n  LOCAL_QUORUM Ensure that the write has been written to <ReplicationFactor> \/ 2 + 1 nodes, within the local datacenter (requires NetworkTopologyStrategy)\n  EACH_QUORUM  Ensure that the write has been written to <ReplicationFactor> \/ 2 + 1 nodes in each datacenter (requires NetworkTopologyStrategy)\n  ALL          Ensure that the write is written to <code>&lt;ReplicationFactor&gt;<\/code> nodes before responding to the client.\n\nRead consistency levels make the following guarantees before returning successful results to the client:\n  ANY          Not supported. You probably want ONE instead.\n  ONE          Returns the record obtained from a single replica.\n  TWO          Returns the record with the most recent timestamp once two replicas have replied.\n  THREE        Returns the record with the most recent timestamp once three replicas have replied.\n  QUORUM       Returns the record with the most recent timestamp once a majority of replicas have replied.\n  LOCAL_QUORUM Returns the record with the most recent timestamp once a majority of replicas within the local datacenter have replied.\n  EACH_QUORUM  Returns the record with the most recent timestamp once a majority of replicas within each datacenter have replied.\n  ALL          Returns the record with the most recent timestamp once all replicas have replied (implies no replica may be down)..\n",
