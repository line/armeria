## New features

- You can now jump to a service method quickly using a go-to form in a `DocService` debug page. #1815
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1866157/59041505-b6dd7100-88b3-11e9-87d5-edc826751620.gif" width="800" />
- From this release, TLSv1.3 is enabled by default. #1779
- `Route` replaces `PathMapping`. #1789
  ```java
  ServerBuilder sb = new ServerBuilder();
  sb.service(Route.builder()
                  .path("/greet/{name}")
                  .consumes(MediaType.JSON)
                  .produces(MediaType.JSON_UTF_8)
                  .build(),
             (ctx, req) -> HttpResponse.of(HttpStatus.OK,
                                           MediaType.JSON_UTF_8,
                                           ...));
  ```
- `AggregatedHttpMessage` has been split into two subtypes: `AggregatedHttpRequest` and `AggregatedHttpResponse`. #1702 #1795
  - The factory methods and some getter methods in `AggregatedHttpMessage` have been pushed down to the two subtypes. For example, `AggregatedHttpMessage.method()` does not exist anymore and you will find it in `AggregatedHttpRequest`.
  - We have revised the API to use `AggregatedHttpRequest` or `AggregatedHttpResponse` rather than `AggregatedHttpMessage` wherever possible for clarity.
- New static factory methods have been added to `HttpData`. #1797

  - `HttpData.of()` was not very clear about whether it will wrap the specified bytes or make a copy of them. `HttpData.wrap()` and `HttpData.copyOf()` removes such ambiguity.

    ```java
    byte[] b = new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 }
    HttpData copied = HttpData.copyOf(b);
    HttpData wrapped = HttpData.wrap(b);

    b[0] = 0;
    assert copied.array()[0] == 1;
    assert wrapped.array()[0] == 0;
    ```

- You can now specify `SubscriptionOption`s when subscribing to a `StreamMessage` to modify the contract between `StreamMessage` and `Subscriber`. #1700 #1808
  ```java
  HttpRequest req = ...;
  // Subscriber.onError() will be invoked with a CancelledSubscriptionException
  // when the Subscription is cancelled.
  req.subscribe(mySubscriber, SubscriptionOption.NOTIFY_CANCELLATION);
  ```
- The `Endpoint`s loaded from a `.properties` file by `PropertiesEndpointGroup` are now automatically updated when the `.properties` file is modified. Note that the classpath resources are not auto-reloaded and you have to specify a real file as a `java.nio.Path`. #1787
  ```java
  PropertiesEndpointGroup endpoints = PropertiesEndpointGroup.of(
          Paths.get("/etc/my/endpoints.properties"),
          "endpoints.");
  ```
- You can now create a `Client` by specifying an `Endpoint` rather than a `URI`. #1743
  ```java
  Endpoint endpoint = Endpoint.of("example.com");
  HttpClient client = new HttpClientBuilder(SessionProtocol.HTTPS, endpoint)
          ...
          .build();
  ```
- You can now apply Armeria's default settings to an existing `DropwizardMeterRegistry` (or `PrometheusMeterRegistry`) using `DropwizardMeterRegistries.configureRegistry()` (or `PrometheusMeterRegistries.configureRegistry()`). Previously, Armeria's default settings were applied only to the `MeterRegistry`s created by `DropwizardMeterRegistries.newRegistry()` (or `PrometheusMeterRegistries.newRegistry()`). #1814 #1820

  ```java
  import io.micrometer.jmx.JmxMeterRegistry;

  // JmxMeterRegistry is a subtype of DropwizardMeterRegistry.
  JmxMeterRegistry jmxRegistry = new JmxMeterRegistry(...);
  DropwizardMeterRegistries.configureRegistry(jmxRegistry);
  ```

- A new exception type `InvalidSamlRequestException` has been added so that you can tell if a client sent an invalid SAML request from exception type. #1780 #1783

## Improvements

- Consolidated the logic related with TLS and improved TLS configuration validation. #1779
- Stack trace is logged for better debuggability when `RequestContextCurrentTraceContext` cannot find the current `RequestContext`. #1800

## Bug fixes

- The percent-encoding of the characters such as `#` and `/` are now preserved correctly. #1805
- gRPC `Metadata` is now supported. #1788 #1790
- Fixed a bug where a bad gRPC client is created when a user specified a URL that does not end with a slash (`/`). #1785
- The trailers added with `ServiceRequestContext.addAdditionalResponseTrailer()` are not ignored anymore. #1782
- JUnit 5 extensions are now initialized and destroyed on `BeforeAll` and `AfterAll` rather than on `Each`. #1801
- `spring-boot-webflux-starter` does not fail to start anymore even if more than one `MeterRegistry` exist. #1791

## Deprecations

- `HttpData.offset()` has been deprecated. It always returns `0`. #1771 #1797
- Some `HttpData.of()` methods have been deprecated in favor of `HttpData.wrap()` and/or `HttpData.copyOf()`. #1797
- `trailingHeaders()` methods in `AggregatedHttpMessage` and `HttpResult` have been deprecated in favor of `trailers()`. #1795
- `StreamMessage` methods which accept `boolean withPooledObjects` have been deprecated. Use the methods that accept `SubscriptionOption` and specify `SubscriptionOption.WITH_POOLED_OBJECTS`. #1700

## Breaking changes

- `AggregatedHttpMessage` has been split into two subtypes. See 'New features' for more information. #1702 #1795
- `PathMapping` and its related classes have been replaced with `Route` and its related classes. See 'New features' for more information. #1789
  - `ServiceWithPathMappings` has been replaced with `ServiceWithRoutes`.
- `ClientCacheControl` and `ServerCacheControl` have been moved to the `com.linecorp.armeria.common` package. #1813 #1816
