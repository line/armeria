# Docker configurations for Athenz integration tests

The test certificate authority (CA) and key pairs are generated by [`create-self-signed-certs.sh`](https://github.com/AthenZ/athenz/blob/a76b62563337ed579a990becb61f664cc3121e1f/docker/setup-scripts/self-signed-certificates.sh) 
and [`acceptance-test.sh`](https://github.com/AthenZ/athenz/blob/a76b62563337ed579a990becb61f664cc3121e1f/docker/deploy-scripts/acceptance-test.sh) scripts.
Please refer to [Athenz Docker documentation](https://github.com/AthenZ/athenz/blob/master/docker/docs/try-out-Athenz-with-self-signed-CA.md) 
for more details on how to set up a self-signed CA for Athenz.
