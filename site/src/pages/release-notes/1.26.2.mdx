## 🛠️ Bug fixes

- Armeria now reuses the connections more efficiently when <type://RetryingClient> is used in conjunction
  with client-side load-balancing. Previously, an excessive number of connections were created when
  requests are retried. #5290
- You no longer see an <type://EndpointSelectionTimeoutException> when selecting an <type://Endpoint> from an
  <type://EndpointGroup>. #5281
- Fixed a bug where Armeria Spring Boot integration is not compatible with Spring Boot 2.6 and earlier. #5279
