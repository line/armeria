## 🎬 Before we begin

This release contains more breaking changes and deprecations than usual, which were necessary for the preparation of 1.0 release and the long term evolution of our API after 1.0. We'd like to apologize for any inconveniences caused by the breaking changes. Please don't forget we're always here for you and do let us know if you have any trouble upgrading, so we can help you!

## 🌟 New features

- Since this release, in preparation of 1.0 release, we annotated classes and packages which may have a chance of breaking change with the `@UnstableApi` annotation. #2445
- The attribute access API of `RequestContext` has been revamped for simplicity. #2322
  ```java
  AttributeKey<String> MY_ATTR = AttributeKey.valueOf("MY_ATTR");
  RequestContext ctx = ...;
  ctx.setAttr(MY_ATTR, "foo");
  assert "foo".equals(ctx.attr(MY_ATTR));
  ```
- When a `RequestContext` is derived or inherited from another `RequestContext`, the parent context's attributes are now visible from the derived or inherited context: #2322
  ```java
  AttributeKey<String> MY_ATTR = AttributeKey.valueOf("MY_ATTR");
  ServiceRequestContext parentCtx = ...;
  ClientRequestContext childCtx = ...;
  assert childCtx.root() == parentCtx;
  parentCtx.setAttr(MY_ATTR, "foo");
  // Root context's attributes are visible from its children.
  assert "foo".equals(childCtx.attr(MY_ATTR));
  // Not visible anymore if the attribute is overwritten.
  childCtx.setAttr(MY_ATTR, "bar");
  assert "foo".equals(parentCtx.attr(MY_ATTR));
  assert "bar".equals(childCtx.attr(MY_ATTR));
  ```
- `{Client,Service}RequestContext` now provides more useful ways to schedule request or response timeout: #2343
  ```java
  Server.builder()
        .service("/svc", myService.decorate((delegate, ctx, req) -> {
            if (req.headers().contains("x-extend-timeout")) {
                // Extend the timeout by 10 seconds.
                ctx.extendRequestTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
            }
            return delegate.serve(ctx, req);
        }));
  ```
- `RequestLog` API has been revamped for safety and usability. #2342
  ```java
  RequestContext ctx = ...;
  // Asynchronous retrieval:
  ctx.log().whenRequestComplete().thenAccept(log -> {
      // Can't access response properties at compilation level.
      assert log instanceof RequestOnlyLog;
      System.err.println(log.toStringRequestOnly());
  })
  ctx.log().whenComplete().thenAccept(log -> {
      // Can access all properties.
      assert log instanceof RequestLog;
      System.err.println(log.toStringResponseOnly());
  });
  ctx.log().whenAvailable(RequestLogProperty.SESSION).thenAccept(log -> {
      // Advanced use case:
      // Raises an exception if accessing an unavailable property.
      System.err.println(log.channel());
  });
  // Accessing a property ensuring availability:
  ctx.log().ensureRequestComplete().requestEndTimeNanos();
  ctx.log().ensureComplete().responseEndTimeNanos();
  ctx.log().ensureAvailable(RequestLogProperty.RESPONSE_CONTENT)
     .responseContent();
  ```
- `RequestLog` also has a new property `NAME`, which can be used as a method name in an RPC call, a span name in distributed tracing or any other human-readable string that can be used for identifying a request. #2413
- Added a new immutable API for encoding and decoding HTTP query strings: #2307
  ```java
  QueryParams params = QueryParams.builder()
                                  .add("foo", "1")
                                  .add("bar", "2")
                                  .build();
  // Encoding
  String queryString = params.toQueryString();
  assert "foo=1&bar=2".equals(queryString);
  // Decoding
  QueryParams decodedParams = QueryParams.fromQueryString("foo=1&bar=2");
  assert decodedParams.equals(params);
  // Mutation
  QueryParams newParams = params.toBuilder()
                                .add("baz", "3")
                                .build();
  assert "foo=1&bar=2&baz=3".equals(newParams.toQueryString());
  ```
- Added various convenient boolean getter methods to `HttpStatus`: #2435
  ```java
  assert HttpStatus.CONTINUE.isInformational();
  assert HttpStatus.OK.isSuccess();
  assert HttpStatus.FOUND.isRedirect();
  assert HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.isClientError();
  assert HttpStatus.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE.isServerError();
  // No need to write like this anymore
  assert HttpStatus.OK.codeClass() == HttpStatusClass.SUCCESS;
  ```
- Added `MediaTypeNames` which provides `String` version of well known `MediaType`s, which is useful when writing an annotated service: #2438
  ```java
  class MyAnnotatedService {
      @Get("/download/zip")
      @Produces(MediaTypeNames.ZIP)
      HttpResponse downloadArchive() { ... }
  }
  ```
- You can now add `{Request,Response}ConverterFunction` and `ExceptionHandlerFunction` to all annotated services in your `Server` easily. #2316
  ```java
  Server.builder()
        .annotatedService("/users", userService)
        .annotatedService("/posts", postService)
        .annotatedService("/files", fileService)
        // Applies all extensions to all 3 annotated services.
        .annotatedServiceExtensions(
            commonRequestConverters,
            commonResponseConverters,
            commonExceptionHandlers)
        .build();
  ```
- You can now require a route to have HTTP headers and/or query parameters: #2102
  ```java
  Server.builder()
        // Route to 'myService' only when:
        // - 'x-must-exist' header exists,
        // - and 'bar' query parameter exists.
        .route().get("/foo")
                .matchesHeaders("x-must-exist")
                .matchesParams("bar")
                .build(myService)
  ```
- You can now customize the `SslContext` created from `ServerBuilder.tlsSelfSigned()` or `VirtualHost.tlsSelfSigned()`: #2340
  ```java
  Server.builder()
        .tlsSelfSigned()
        .tlsCustomizer(sslCtxBuilder -> {
            sslCtxBuilder.ciphers(...);
        })
  ```
- You can now close an `EndpointGroup` asynchronously: #2430
  ```java
  DnsAddressEndpointGroup group =
      DnsAddressEndpointGroup.of("cluster.com", 8080);
  group.whenClosed().thenRun(() -> {
      System.err.println("Closed!");
  });
  group.closeAsync();
  ```
- You do not need to register your `EndpointGroup` to `EndpointGroupRegistry` for client-side load balancing. Just specify it when you build a client: #2381
  ```java
  EndpointGroup group = EndpointGroup.of(
      Endpoint.of("node1.cluster.com"),
      Endpoint.of("node2.cluster.com"));
  // Thrift
  HelloService.Iface client =
      Clients.builder("tbinary+http", group)
             .path("/api/thrift/hello")
             .build(HelloService.Iface.class);
  // gRPC
  HelloServiceBlockingStub client =
      Clients.builder("gproto+http", group)
             .build(HelloServiceBlockingStub.class);
  // Web
  WebClient client =
      WebClient.of(SessionProtocol.HTTP, group);
  ```
- You can now limit the number of endpoints in `HealthCheckedEndpointGroup`, which is very useful when there are many candidate endpoints in the group but you want to send requests to only a few of them, to avoid unnecessarily large number of outbound connections: #2177
  ```java
  HealthCheckedEndpointGroup group =
      HealthCheckedEndpointGroup.builder(delegateGroup, "/health")
                                .maxEndpointCount(3)
                                .build();
  ```
- You can now capture the `ClientRequestContext` of your client call with `ClientRequestContextCaptor`: #2344
  ```java
  WebClient client = WebClient.of("http://foo.com/");
  try (ClientRequestContextCaptor ctxCaptor = Clients.newContextCaptor()) {
      HttpResponse res = client.get("/");
      ClientRequestContext ctx = ctxCaptor.get();
      ...
  }
  ```
- Added `ClientFactory.insecure()` and `ClientFactoryBuilder.tlsNoVerify()` to simplify testing SSL/TLS connections with self-signed certificates: #2340
  ```java
  // Using the default insecure factory
  WebClient.builder("https://127.0.0.1:8443")
           .factory(ClientFactory.insecure())
           .build();
  // Using a custom insecure factory
  WebClient.builder("https://127.0.0.1:8443")
           .factory(ClientFactory.builder()
                                 .tlsNoVerify()
                                 ...
                                 .build())
           .build();
  ```
- `ClientFactory` is now part of `ClientOptions` for easier creation of derived clients. #2384
  ```java
  ClientFactory factory = ...;
  WebClient client =
      WebClient.builder(...)
               .factory(factory)
               .build();
  WebClient clientCopy =
      WebClient.builder(...)
               .options(client.options())
               .build();
  // Note that ClientFactory is copied as well.
  assert client.factory() == clientCopy.factory();
  ```
- `RetrofitMeterIdPrefixFunction` is now capable of adding HTTP method and request path pattern if you specify a Retrofit service class: #2356
- New module `armeria-dropwizard` provides the integration with [Dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/), which allows you to leverage the best of the both worlds. #2236
  - See [Using Armeria with Dropwizard](https://armeria.dev/docs/advanced-dropwizard-integration) for more information.
  - Special thanks to @cricket007 who volunteered for this.
- You can now customize `DocService` when integrating with Spring framework by injecting `DocServiceConfigurator`: #2327
  ```java
  @Bean
  public DocServiceConfigurator docServiceConfigurator() {
      // Exclude all Thrift services from DocService.
      return docServiceBuilder -> {
          docServiceBuilder.exclude(DocServiceFilter.ofThrift());
      };
  }
  ```
- `ServerRule` (JUnit 4) and `ServerExtension` (JUnit 5) now have more getters: #2449
  - `Endpoint` getters:
    - `endpoint(SessionProtocol)`, `httpEndpoint()` and `httpsEndpoint()`
  - `URI` getters:
    - `uri(SessionProtocol)`, `uri(SessionProtocol, SerializationFormat)`, `httpUri()`, `httpUri(SerializationFormat)`, `httpsUri()` and `httpsUri(SerializationFormat)`
    - The old deprecated getters return `String` instead of `URI`.
  - `InetSocketAddress` getters:
    - `socketAddress(SessionProtocol)`
- The `CompletableFuture`s returned by our API will leave a warning log like the following when you perform a blocking operation in an event loop thread: #2275
  ```
  Calling a blocking method on CompletableFuture from an event loop or
  non-blocking thread. You should never do this ...
  java.lang.IllegalStateException: Blocking event loop, don't do this.
  ```
  You can disable this functionality by specifying the `-Dcom.linecorp.armeria.reportBlockedEventLoop=false` JVM option.
- You can now serialize and deserialize `ThriftCall`, `ThriftReply`, `TMessage` and `TBase` into TTEXT JSON using `ThriftJacksonModule`. #2439
  ```java
  ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
  mapper.registerModule(new ThriftJacksonModule());
  ```
- You can now make any SLF4J `Logger` context-aware with `RequestContext.makeContextAware(Logger)`: #2341
  ```java
  // Prints 'Hello!'
  Logger logger = ...;
  logger.info("Hello!");
  // Prints '[<current context>] Hello!'
  Logger ctxAwareLogger = ctx.makeContextAware(logger);
  ctxAwareLogger("Hello!");
  ```
- `RequestContextExporter` is now part of the core API, allowing you to integrate with other logging frameworks than Logback, such as Log4J2. #2314
- You can now disable HTTP header validation the the `-Dcom.linecorp.armeria.validateHeaders=false` JVM option.

## 📈 Improvements

- Slightly reduced memory footprint of `Logging{Client,Service}` #2341
- `UnknownHostException` raised by Armeria now explains what DNS query has failed. #2332
- `WebClient` now accepts a URI that starts with `none+` as well. #2361
- `HealthCheckedEndpointGroup` now logs a helpful warning message when it receives a 4XX response. #2401
- Our builder API Javadoc does not show mysterious return type parameter such as `B` and `SELF` anymore. #2454
- A client now gets `SSLException` instead of `ClosedSessionException` if a connection attempt fails with an SSL/TLS handshake error. #2338

## 🔒 Security fixes

- N/A

## 🛠️ Bug fixes

- `WebClient` does not omit a request query string when sending a request to an absolute URI. #2309

## 🏚️ Deprecations

- `HttpParameters` has been deprecated in favor of `QueryParams` #2307
- `ServerBuilder.tls()` methods that require a `Consumer` have been deprecated. Use `tlsCustomizer(Consumer)` instead. #2340
  ```java
  // Before:
  Server.builder()
        .tls(..., sslCtxBuilder -> { ... });
  // After:
  Server.builder()
        .tls(...)
        .tlsCustomizer(sslCtxBuilder -> { ... });
  ```
- Many classes which have `Http` in their names have been deprecated in favor of those without `Http`, e.g. #2323
  - `RetryingHttpClient` -> `RetryingClient`
  - `HttpFileService` -> `FileService`
- Many builder classes' constructors have been deprecated in favor of `builder()` static methods, e.g. #1719
  - `new ClientBuilder()` -> `Clients.builder()`
  - `new ArmeriaRetrofitBuilder()` -> `ArmeriaRetrofit.builder()`
  - `new ServerCacheControlBuilder()` -> `ServerCacheControl.builder()`
- Many public static final fields that are not truly constants have been deprecated in favor of static factory methods, e.g.
  - `EndpointSelectionStrategy.ROUND_ROBIN` -> `roundRogin()`
  - `NodeValueCodec.DEFAULT` -> `ofDefault()`
  - `AuthTokenExtractors.BASIC` -> `basic()`
- `MoreNamingConventions` has been deprecated because we follow Micrometer's recommended naming convention. #2367
- `Version.identify()` has been deprecated in favor of `getAll()` #2398
- `ServiceRequestContext.setRequestTimeout*()` has been deprecated in favor of `extendRequestTimeout*()`, `setRequestTimeoutAfter*()`, `setRequestTimeoutAt*()` and `clearRequestTimeout()`. #2343
- `ClientRequestContext.setResponseTimeout*()` has been deprecated in favor of `extendResponseTimeout*()`, `setResponseTimeoutAfter*()`, `setResponseTimeoutAt*()` and `clearResponseTimeout()`. #2343
- Many methods that return a `CompletableFuture` have been renamed from `*Future()` to `when*()`, e.g. #2427
  - `HttpRequest.completionFuture()` -> `whenComplete()`
  - `HttpResponseWriter.onDemand()` -> `whenConsumed()`
  - `EndpointGroup.initialEndpointsFuture()` -> `whenReady()`
- Many URI-returning methods in `ServerRule` and `ServerExtension` have been deprecated in favor of the new methods that do not require a path parameter: #2449
  ```java
  ServerExtension server = ...;
  // Before
  server.httpUri("/");
  server.httpUri("/foo");
  // After
  server.httpUri();
  server.httpUri().resolve("/foo");
  ```
- `THttpService.allowedSerializationFormats()` has been deprecated in favor of `supportedSerializationFormats()` for consistency with `GrpcService`. #2453
- `Service.decorate(Class)` has been deprecated in favor of other `decorate()` methods that require a function.
- `ClosedPublisherException` has been deprecated in favor of `ClosedStreamException`. #2468

## ☢️ Breaking changes

- Most revamped APIs in this release were changed in a backward-incompatible way:
  - `RequestLog`
  - Attribute API in `RequestContext`
- Content previewing mechanism has been revamped into decorators. Use `ContentPreviewingClient` and `ContentPreviewingService`.
- You cannot add callbacks to `RequestContext` anymore because we found this feature results in poor performance and confusing behavior in many cases. We may want to revisit this feature if there is a valid use case for it.
- `{Server,VirtualHost}Builder.tls()` methods do not throw an `SSLException` anymore. `build()` will throw an `IllegalStateException` instead. As a result, any SSL configuration failure will be known when a user calls `build()`, rather than `tls()`.
- We were not able to keep some classes or method signatures while we remove `Http` from class names.
- `ServiceRequestContext.logger()` has been removed due to performance issues with Log4J2.
- `RequestContext.isTimedOut()` has been removed.
- We do not support Tomcat 8.0 anymore, which was obsoleted by Tomcat 8.5 anyway.
- The classes in `armeria-grpc-protocol` have been reorganized into multiple packages.
- Our Micrometer meter IDs have been changed, which means you might need to update your monitoring configuration. If you wish to switch back to the legacy naming style, specify the `-Dcom.linecorp.armeria.useLegacyMeterNamed=true` JVM option. However, please keep in mind this option will eventually go away, because the new naming convention is recommended by Micrometer.
- All our methods do not return `Optional` anymore. They are all `@Nullable` now. If you wish to continue using `Optional`, just wrap the return value with `Optional.ofNullable()`.
- `EndpointGroupRegistry` has been removed, because you can now just specify an `EndpointGroup` directly when creating a client.
  - As a result, you need to specify an `EndpointSelectionStrategy` when building an `EndpointGroup`. If unspecified, `EndpointSelectionStrategy.weightedRoundRobin()` is used.
- `MeterIdPrefixFunction` is not a functional interface anymore. You must implement two methods explicitly: `activeRequestPrefix()` and `completeRequestPrefix()`.
- Now that `ClientFactory` is a part of `ClientOption`, the following code will not work as expected, because `options(options)` will overwrite the factory.
  ```java
  ClientOptions options = ClientOptions.builder().maxResponseLength(...).build();
  ClientFactory factory = ClientFactory.builder().useHttp2Preface(false).build();
  WebClient client = WebClient.builder(...)
                              .factory(factory)
                              .options(options)
                              .build();
  // This will fail!
  assert client.options().factory() == factory;
  ```
  To fix this, you must call `options()` first, and then override the individual properties:
  ```java
  WebClient client = WebClient.builder(...)
                              .options(options)
                              .factory(factory)
                              .build();
  ```
- `StreamMessage.subscribe(..., boolean withPooledObjects)` has been removed. Use `subscribe(..., SubscriptionOption.WITH_POOLED_OBJECTS)`.
- `StreamMessage.drainAll(..., boolean withPooledObjects)` has been removed. Use `drainAll(..., SubscriptionOption.WITH_POOLED_OBJECTS)`.
- `HttpRequestDuplicator` and `HttpResponseDuplicator` are now interfaces. Use `HttpRequest.toDuplicator()` and `HttpResponse.toDuplicator()` to create a duplicator.
- `StructuredLog` and `StructuredLoggingService` have been removed. Use `AccessLogWriter`.
- `ThriftStructuredLogJsonFormat` has been removed. Register `ThriftJacksonModule` to `ObjectMapper` to serialize or deserialize Thrift objects.
