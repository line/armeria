## 🛠️ Bug fixes

- Fixed the HTTP content corruption #3894
  - The corruption occurs when all the following 3 conditions are met:
    - A request or response is streaming, such as using <type://HttpResponse#streaming()>;
    - its content is longer than 16378 bytes; and
    - its session protocol is <type://SessionProtocol#H1> (HTTP/1 over TLS).
  - Note that cleartext or HTTP/2 connections are unaffected.
- HTTP/JSON-to-gRPC transcoding now works with imported types. #3891 #3892
