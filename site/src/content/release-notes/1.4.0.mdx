# v1.4.0

## 🌟 New features

- You can now register/discover your servers to/from [Consul](https://www.consul.io/)
  using a new `armeria-consul` module. #194 #2192 #3002 #3281

  ```java
  // Registration
  Server server = ...;
  server.addListener(
    ConsulUpdatingListener.builder(myConsulUri, "myService")
                          .consulToken(myConsulAccessToken)
                          .build());
  server.start().join();

  // Discovery
  ConsulEndpointGroup endpointGroup =
    ConsulEndpointGroup.builder(myConsulUri, "myService")
                       .consulToken(myConsulAccessToken)
                       .build();
  ```

- You can now smoothly ramp up the weight of newly added [Endpoint](type) in
  an [EndpointGroup](type) using [EndpointSelectionStrategy#rampingUp()](type)
  to protect a fresh node from getting too much traffic suddenly. #1757 #3217

  ```java
  EndpointGroup endpointGroup =
    DnsAddressEndpointGroup
      .builder("my.hostname.local")
      .selectionStrategy(EndpointSelectionStrategy.rampingUp())
      .build();

  // Customize as necessary.
  EndpointSelectionStrategy
    .builderForRampingUp()
    // Ramp up a fresh endpoint for 60 seconds,
    // increasing weight every second.
    .rampingUpInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
    .numberSteps(60)
    .build();
  ```

- You can now start your server as unhealthy with
  [HealthCheckServiceBuilder#startUnhealthy()](type). #3260
  - This can be useful when you don't want to handle incoming requests immediately
    after startup but after some operational steps, such as warming up.
- You can now add [HealthCheckUpdateListener](typeplural) to
  [HealthCheckService](type) to get notified when healthiness is updated externally,
  e.g., from a `POST` request handled by [HealthCheckUpdateHandler](type). #3260
  - This can be useful when used in combination with `startUnhealthy()` above.
- You can now specify a custom HTTP header naming rule for HTTP/1 connections,
  so that you can work around the interoperability issues with old HTTP/1 servers
  that don't recognize lower-cased headers such as `content-length`. #3196 #3259
  ```java
  ClientFactory factory =
    ClientFactory.builder()
                 // Send 'Content-Length', not 'content-length'.
                 .http1HeaderNaming(http1HeaderNaming.traditional())
                 .build();
  WebClient client =
    WebClient.builder()
             .factory(factory)
             .build();
  ```
- You can now close a connection after handling a certain number of requests or
  after a certain period of time, rather than keeping it open indefinitely. #203 #3267
  - [v0.99.7](/release-notes/0.99.7) introduced this feature partially for the server
    side. We expanded it into both client and server side and also added a way
    to disconnect after handling a certain number of requests.

    ```java
    // For server
    Server.builder()
          // A connection will be closed after
          // sending the 10000th request's response.
          .maxNumRequestsPerConnection(10000);

    // For client
    ClientFactory.builder()
                 // A connection will be closed after
                 // receiving the 2000th request's response.
                 .maxNumRequestsPerConnection(2000);
    ```

- You can now turn any service into a transient service by decorating it with
  [TransientHttpService](type) or [TransientRpcService](type). #3221
  - By making a service transient, you can disable metric collection by
    [MetricCollectingService](type), service logging by [LoggingService](type) or
    access logging by [AccessLogWriter](type).
  - The following example disables metric collection, service and access logs for
    [HealthCheckService](type):
    ```java
    Server.builder()
          .serviceUnder(
            "/internal/l7check",
            HealthCheckService.of()
                              .decorate(TransientHttpService.newDecorator()))
          .build()
    ```
- You can now disable the check that rejects potentially unsafe TLS cipher suites
  when configuring server-side TLS, at your own risk. #3292
  ```java
  Server.builder()
        .tlsAllowUnsafeCiphers()
        .tlsCustomizer(sslCtxBuilder -> {
          sslCtxBuilder.ciphers(Set.of(
            "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA" // Bad cipher suite
          ))
        })
        ...
  ```
- You can now get, set and parse a `Content-Disposition` header using
  [ContentDisposition](type). #3253

  ```java
  // Setting
  HttpHeaders headers = HttpHeaders.of(
    HttpHeaderNames.CONTENT_DISPOSITION,
    ContentDisposition.of("attachment", "fileName", "file.png"));

  // Getting
  ContentDisposition disposition = headers.contentDisposition();
  assert "attachment".equals(disposition.type());
  assert "fileName".equals(disposition.name());
  assert "file.png".equals(disposition.filename());

  // Parsing
  ContentDisposition parsed = ContentDisposition.parse(
    "attachment; name=\"fileName\"; filename=\"file.png\"");
  assert parsed.equals(disposition);
  ```

- You can now serve a file by returning an [HttpFile](type) in an annotated service. #3258 #3287
  ```java
  Server
    .builder()
    .annotatedService(new Object() {
      @Get
      @Head
      @Path("/files/{fileName}")
      HttpFile myFile(@Param String fileName) {
        return HttpFile.of(new File("/var/www/" + fileName));
      }
    })
    .build();
  ```
- You can now invoke `Runnable` or `Callable` with [RequestContext](type) set in
  the thread-local storage using [RequestContext#run(Runnable)](type) and
  [RequestContext#run(Callable)](type). #3311
  ```java
  Runnable task = () -> {
    logger.info("Current request: {}", ServiceRequestContext.current());
  };
  ctx.run(task);
  ```
- You can now concat multiple `Publisher`s into one using
  [StreamMessage#concat(Iterable)](type). #3254 #3299

  ```java
  StreamMessage<String> stream =
    StreamMessage.concat(Mono.just("foo"),
                         Mono.just("bar"));

  StepVerifier.create(stream)
              .expectNext("foo")
              .expectNext("bar")
              .expectComplete()
              .verify()

  // You can also concat a `Publisher` of `Publisher`s.
  StreamMessage<String> flat =
    StreamMessage.concat(Flux.just(Mono.just("foo"),
                                   Mono.just("bar")));
  ```

- You can now create an [HttpResponse](type) from a [ResponseHeaders](type) and
  a stream of [HttpData](typeplural) using
  [HttpResponse#of(ResponseHeaders,Publisher)](type). #3089 #3237
  ```java
  HttpResponse res = HttpResponse.of(
    ResponseHeaders.of(200),
    Flux.just("one\n", "two\n", "three\n")
        .map(HttpData::ofUtf8));
  ```
- You can now check which native transports are available or not and why they are
  unavailable using [TransportType#isAvailable()](type) and
  [TransportType#unavailabilityCause()](type). #3244
  ```java
  if (!TransportType.EPOLL.isAvailable()) {
    logger.warn("/dev/epoll support not available:",
                TransportType.EPOLL.unavailabilityCause());
  }
  ```

  - We also added methods like `serverChannelType()`, `socketChannelType()` and
    `datagramChannelType()`, which may be useful when you need to deal with Netty
    channels.
- You can now decode the body of [HttpRequest](type) or [HttpResponse](type) into
  a [StreamMessage](type) using [HttpMessage#decode(HttpDecoder)](type). #3215
  - This feature can be useful when you need to reactively decode an HTTP body.
    For example, Armeria will use this feature to handle a multipart body.
- Added [StreamMessage#demand()](type) that returns the remaining demand of
  the current subscription. #3215
- Added `withTags(Tag...)` method to [MeterIdPrefixFunction](type). #3241 #3242
- You can now register a custom gRPC client stub factory via SPI or
  [GrpcClientOptions#GRPC_CLIENT_STUB_FACTORY](type) option. #3214 #3294
- You can now keep using the old decoration ordering for route decorators by
  specifying the `-Dcom.linecorp.armeria.useLegacyRouteDecoratorOrdering=true`
  JVM option. #3279

{/* truncate */}

## 📈 Improvements

- You can now run your Armeria application even if `netty-transport-native-epoll` and
  `netty-incubator-transport-native-io_uring` are not in the class path. #3244
- You can now use `/dev/epoll` transport on WSL 2. #3244
- You can now use [JettyService](type) with Jetty 9.3. We previously supported
  Jetty 9.4 only. #3288
- We improved how we shut down a [Server](type) in our Spring Boot integration
  so it's more future-proof. #3266

## 🛠️ Bug fixes

- The future returned by [StreamWriter#whenConsumed()](type) is now completed
  immediately even when the current demand is `0`. #3213
- Fixed the violation of Reactive Streams specification when `null` is published. #3212 #3216
- [TomcatService](type) does not raise a `NullPointerException` when it stops.
  #3136 #3218
- Fixed stability and interoperability issues in Eureka service discovery module.
  #3235 #3275 #3238 #3301
- The service name generated from a CGLIB-enhanced class does not have synthetic
  suffix anymore. #3103 #3240
- [HealthCheckedEndpointGroup](type) now refreshes its [Endpoint](typeplural)'
  status when their weights are changed. #3236
- You'll no longer see a `NullPointerException` when retrying a gRPC request. #3251
- Fixed the incorrect return type of some builder methods. #3220
- Fixed a UI glitch in the go-to form of [DocService](type) client #3261
- You'll no longer see a harmless `Http2Exception: Stream N does not exist`
  warning log message anymore. #3233
  - You'll see it if there was really a protocol violation, however.
- Fixed an issue where a [RequestLog](type) is sometimes not completed immediately. #3291
- TLS is now configured only once in Spring Boot WebFlux integration. #3266
- Armeria now finds the gRPC `ServiceDescriptor` correctly from the code
  generated with [Reactive-gRPC](https://github.com/salesforce/reactive-grpc). #3294
- A request refused with HTTP/2 `REFUSED_STREAM` error code now fails with
  an [UnprocessedRequestException](type), so it can be safely retried. #3298
- [THttpService](type) can now handle the Thrift code generated with the `fullcamel`
  option. #3272
- [ZooKeeperUpdatingListener](type) does not raise an `IllegalStateException` anymore
  even if the given Curator client is started already. #3305

## 🏚️ Deprecations

- `*ChannelType()` methods in [EventLoopGroups](type) have been deprecated in favor of
  the new methods in [TransportType](type). #3244
- [CircuitBreakerRpcClient#newPerHostAndMethodDecorator()](type) has been deprecated
  in favor of [CircuitBreakerRpcClient#newDecorator(CircuitBreakerMapping,CircuitBreakerRuleWithContent)](type).
  #3249

## ☢️ Breaking changes

- `armeria-tomcat9` and `armeria-tomcat8` don't depend on `tomcat-embed-jasper`
  anymore, which was pulled into runtime dependencies by mistake. #3256
- You have to recompile your application because we changed the return type of
  some builder methods. #3220
- Changes in the API annotated with [@UnstableApi](type):
  - `HttpDeframer` has been replaced with [HttpMessage#decode(HttpDecoder)](type). #3215
