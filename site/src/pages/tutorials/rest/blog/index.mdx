# REST tutorial introduction

Using Armeria's annotations, you can build RESTful services on the go.
Through this tutorial, you'll learn to build a RESTful service with Armeria.
In particular, you'll be using these Armeria features:

- [Service annotations](/docs/server-annotated-service)
- [Request converter](/docs/server-annotated-service#converting-an-http-request-to-a-java-object)
- [Parameter injection](/docs/server-annotated-service#injecting-value-of-parameters-and-http-headers-into-a-java-object)
- [Exception handler](/docs/server-annotated-service#handling-exceptions)
- [Blocking task executor](/docs/server-annotated-service/#specifying-a-blocking-task-executor)

This tutorial is based on a [sample service](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/tree/master/tutorials/rest-api-annotated-service), a minimal blog service, with which you can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
To keep our focus on Armeria, this tutorial and the sample service use memory-based operations instead of database operations.

[Try writing a service yourself](#try-writing-blog-service-yourself) by following this tutorial or have a go at [running the sample service](#build-and-run-sample-service) right away.

## Assumptions

This tutorial assumes that you have:

- Experience in building services in Java
- Experience in Java frameworks for server-side programming
- Understanding of RESTful APIs and how to implement them

## Prerequisites

To run and develop the sample service, set your computer with the requirements:

- JDK 11 or higher
- Gradle: Set your Gradle to compile Java with the [-parameters](/docs/setup/#configure--parameters-javac-option) option

## Sample service

The sample service provides you implementations of CRUD operations as specified below.

| Operation | Method | Annotation |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Create | `createBlogPost()` | <type://@Post> |
| Read | `getBlogPost()`, `getBlogPosts()` | <type://@Get> |
| Update | `updateBlogPost()` | <type://@Put> |
| Delete | `deleteBlogPost()` | <type://@Delete> |

### Sample service structure

The [sample service code](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/tree/master/tutorials/rest-api-annotated-service) consists of the following folders and files.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{
{T
+ rest-api-annotated-service
++ src
+++ main
++++ java
+++++ example.armeria.server.blog
++++++ BadRequestExceptionHandler.java
++++++ BlogPost.java
++++++ BlogPostRequestConverter.java
++++++ BlogService.java
++++++ Main.java
+++ test
++++ java
+++++ example.armeria.server.blog
++++++ BlogServiceTest.java
+++ build.gradle
}
}
@endsalt
```

### build.gradle

Here is a part of the build.gradle file for the sample service. If you are trying the tutorial from scratch, base your file on the sample service's.

<CodeBlock language="groovy" filename="build.gradle">{`
  apply plugin: 'java'
  apply plugin: 'idea'
  apply plugin: 'eclipse'\n
  repositories {
      mavenCentral()
  }\n
  dependencies {
      implementation "com.linecorp.armeria:armeria:${versions['com.linecorp.armeria:armeria-bom']}"\n
      // Logging
      runtimeOnly 'ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:${versions['ch.qos.logback:logback-classic']}'
      runtimeOnly 'org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j:${versions['org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j']}'
  }
`}</CodeBlock>

## Build and run sample service

Have a go at running the sample service and experience the outcome of this tutorial.
Using Armeria's [Documentation Service](/docs/server-docservice), you can see a server running, receiving requests and sending responses.

1. Download the code from [here](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/tree/master/tutorials/rest-api-annotated-service).
2. Build the sample service using the Gradle Wrapper.
  ```bash
  $ ./gradlew build
  ```
3. Run the sample service again, using the Gradle Wrapper.
  ```bash
  $ ./gradlew run
  ```
4. Open the Documentation service page on your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs.

## Try writing blog service yourself

Try writing the blog service yourself by following the guides in the given order:

1. [Creating a server](/tutorials/rest/blog/create-server)
2. [Preparing a data object](/tutorials/rest/blog/prepare-data-object)
3. [Adding services to server](/tutorials/rest/blog/add-services-to-server)
4. [Implementing CREATE operation](/tutorials/rest/blog/implenment-create)
5. [Implementing READ operation](/tutorials/rest/blog/implenment-read)
6. [Implementing UPDATE operation](/tutorials/rest/blog/implenment-update)
7. [Implementing DELETE operation](/tutorials/rest/blog/implenment-delete)
