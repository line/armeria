/**
 * Automatically server registration by using ZooKeeper.
 * {@link com.linecorp.armeria.server.zookeeper.ZooKeeperUpdatingListener} can automatically register a
 * server to a ZooKeeper cluster. The registered ZooKeeper node is EPHEMERAL, so when server stops or a network
 * partition occurs, the underlying ZooKeeper session will be closed and the node will be automatically removed
 * by ZooKeeper cluster. As a result, the clients that use a ZooKeeperEndpointGroup will be notified and they
 * will update their endpoint list automatically, so that they do not attempt to connect to the unreachable
 * servers.
