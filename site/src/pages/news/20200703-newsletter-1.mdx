Do you remember we once told you Armeria 1.0.0 will be out around the end of 2019? It's already 50% past
2020, COVID-19 still strays around the city, and we have yet a few issues in our ever-growing backlog for
the next release. Nevertheless, I feel like 1.0.0 is really close this time.

## From the devs

- We now have our own domain, [armeria.dev](https://armeria.dev/)! ðŸŒŸ
- [Armeria 0.99.8](/release-notes/0.99.8), [0.99.7](/release-notes/0.99.7) and [0.99.6](/release-notes/0.99.6)
  have been released.
  - New <type://CircuitBreakerRule> and <type://CircuitBreakerRuleWithContent> API let you define a complex
    circuit breaking policy conveniently.
  - You can now specify the maximum lifespan of server-side connections using
    <type://ServerBuilder#maxConnectionAge(Duration)>. This is useful when you have to deal with a load
    balancer without HTTP/2 support.
  - Service discovery and registration for
    [Curator Service Discovery](https://curator.apache.org/curator-x-discovery/index.html) and
    [Finagle ServerSets](http://stevenskelton.ca/finagle-serverset-clusters-using-zookeeper/).
