/**
 * A variant of <a href="http://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive Streams</a> {@link Publisher}, which allows
 * only one {@link Subscriber}. Unlike a usual {@link Publisher}, a {@link StreamMessage} can stream itself
 * only once.  It has the following additional operations on top of what the Reactive Streams API provides:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #isOpen()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #isEmpty()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #closeFuture()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #abort()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>When is a {@link StreamMessage} open?</h3>
 *
 * <p>A {@link StreamMessage} is open since its instantiation until:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the {@link Subscriber} consumes all elements and {@link Subscriber#onComplete()} is invoked,</li>
 *   <li>an error occurred and {@link Subscriber#onError(Throwable)} is invoked,</li>
 *   <li>the {@link Subscription} has been cancelled or</li>
 *   <li>{@link #abort()} has been requested.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Getting notified when a {@link StreamMessage} is closed</h3>
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #closeFuture()}
 *
 * @param <T> the type of element signaled
