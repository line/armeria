## New features

- You can now specify decorators for all services in a `Server` in a functional way. #1882 #1900
  ```java
  ServerBuilder sb = new ServerBuilder();
  sb.service(...);
  // After:
  sb.decorator((delegate, ctx, req) -> {
      ...
      return delegate.serve(ctx, req);
  });
  // Before:
  sb.decorator(delegate -> new SimpleServiceDecorator<HttpRequest, HttpResponse>(delegate) {
      @Override
      public HttpResponse serve(ServiceRequestContext ctx, HttpRequest req) throws Exception {
          ...
          return delegate().serve(ctx, req);
      }
  });
  ```
- You can now use `HealthCheckService` which has richer functionality than its predecessor `HttpHealthCheckService`. #1878
  ```java
  ServerBuilder sb = new ServerBuilder();
  sb.service("/internal/l7check",
             HealthCheckService.builder()
                               .checkers(...)
                               .healthyResponse(...)
                               .unhealthyResponse(...)
                               .longPolling(Durations.ofMinutes(1))
                               .updatable(true)
                               .build());
  ```
  - Long-polling query support
    - You can wait until the server becomes healthy or unhealthy and get notified immediately.
  - Easy customization of healthy/unhealthy responses
  - Easy customization of update request handler
- You now know exact host you are sending your request to when using Armeria client. #1917
  - It was previously not possible when you specified an `EndpointGroup` as the destination.
  - Therefore, `ClientRequestContext.endpoint()` may return `null` since this release when Armeria failed to determine the destination host.
  - `ClientRequestContext.endpointSelector()` has been added so that you still know which `EndpointGroup` you are connecting to.
- `BraveClient` and `BraveService` now accept `HttpTracing` as well as `Tracing`. #1223 #1906

  ```java
  Tracing tracing = ...;

  // Server-side
  ServerBuilder sb = new ServerBuilder();
  //// Before
  sb.service("/", myService.decorate(BraveService.newDecorator(tracing)));
  //// After
  HttpTracing httpTracing = HttpTracing.create(tracing);
  sb.service("/", myService.decorate(BraveService.newDecorator(httpTracing)));

  // Client-side
  HttpClientBuilder cb = new HttpClientBuilder(...);
  //// Before
  cb.decorator(BraveClient.newDecorator(tracing, "myBackend"));
  //// After
  cb.decorator(BraveClient.newDecorator(httpTracing.clientOf("myBackend")));
  ```

- You can now create a decorating `Service` or `Client` in a less verbose way by extending new `SimpleDecorating*` classes. #1881 #1925
  - `SimpleDecoratingHttpService extends SimpleDecoratingService<HttpRequest, HttpResponse>`
  - `SimpleDecoratingRpcService extends SimpleDecoratingService<RpcRequest, RpcResponse>`
  - `SimpleDecoratingHttpClient extends SimpleDecoratingClient<HttpRequest, HttpResponse>`
  - `SimpleDecoratingRpcClient extends SimpleDecoratingClient<RpcRequest, RpcResponse>`
- `RpcService` has been added for your convenience. #1881 #1925
  - `RpcService extends Service<RpcRequest, RpcResponse>`

## Improvements

- The output type of `RequestLog` sanitizer functions has been relaxed to `?` so that a user can write much simpler and more efficient sanitizer function. #1810 #1879
  ```java
  // Before
  Function<HttpHeaders, HttpHeaders> sanitizer = headers -> {
      return headers.toBuilder().removeAndThen("authorization").build();
  };
  // After
  Function<HttpHeaders, Object> sanitizer = headers -> {
      // No need to construct a new HttpHeaders object.
      return headers.toBuilder().removeAndThen("authorization").toString();
  };
  // Even more efficiently
  Function<HttpHeaders, Object> sanitizer = headers -> "sanitized!";
  ```
- A glob path mapping is not translated into a regex path mapping when combined with path prefix anymore. #1929
- `ByteBufHttpData.toInputStream()` does not perform extra memory copy anymore. #1918 #1919

## Bug fixes

- Armeria client now sends `OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1` instead of `HEAD / HTTP/1.1`, so that the initial protocol upgrade does not trigger business logic when a server has business logic bound at `/`. #1895 #1896
- Response content is not sanitized twice anymore. #1879
- gRPC message compression is now enabled by default on the server side, so that the default behavior matches that of the upstream implementation. #1885 #1889
- The `max-age` attribute in a `set-cookie` header is now handled correctly when using Spring WebFlux. #1904
- Fixed a bug where the base URL of the received request is set incorrectly when using Spring WebFlux. #1904
- `HttpHealthCheckedEndpoint` does not leak connections and requests after `close()` is called. #1899
- `BraveClient` does not trigger `RequestLogAvailabilityException` anymore when the request being traced has failed without sending any data. #1911 #1912
- `@ConsumesJson` annotation now accepts JSON documents with any charsets rather than only `UTF-8`. #1920
- The `IllegalStateException` raised by `pushIfAbsent()` is now propagated properly to the `CompletableFuture` created by `RequestContext.makeContextAware()`. #1920

## Deprecations

- `HttpHealthCheckService` and `SettableHttpHealthCheckService` have been deprecated in favor of `HealthCheckService` and its builder. #1878

## Breaking changes

- `ClientRequestContext.endpoint()` may return `null` since this release. #1917
- The `Endpoint` returned by `ClientRequestContext.endpoint()` now always refers to a single host, not an `EndpointGroup`. #1917
  - Use `ClientRequestContext.endpointSelector().group()` to retrieve the related `EndpointGroup`.

## Dependencies

- gRPC 1.21.0 -> 1.22.1
- Netty 4.1.37 -> 4.1.38
- Tomcat 9.0.21 -> 9.0.22, 8.5.42 -> 8.5.43
