## From the devs

‚ú® [Armeria 1.4.0](/release-notes/1.4.0/) has been released.

- [Consul](https://consul.io/) service discovery support
  - [Consul Registration for Server](/docs/server-service-registration/#consul-based-service-registration-with-consulupdatinglistener)
  - [Consul Service Discovery for Client](/docs/client-service-discovery/#consul-based-service-discovery-with-consulendpointgroup)
- Protect a fresh node from getting too much traffic suddenly by smoothly ramping up the weight of
  <typeplural://Endpoint> in an <type://EndpointGroup> using <type://EndpointSelectionStrategy#rampingUp()>.
- Ability to close a connection after handling a certain number of requests or after a certain period of time,
  rather than keeping it open indefinitely.

üèÜ We nominated contributors for a reward!

- From the last contributor reward in April 2019 to Armeria 1.3.0 release in December 2020,
  Armeria got 63 contributors.

- As a token of appreciation, we've sent a thank you note with a gift. 
- Thanks all for participating with us, and we're looking forward to seeing you keep it up with this year. üòÑ

üìù [Building a gRPC Client Standard with Open Source to Boost Reliability and Velocity](https://doordash.engineering/2021/01/12/building-a-grpc-client-standard-with-open-source/) | by @haithamgabr

  like DNS service discovery, client-side load balancing, and circuit breaker.

üé§ [A Bootiful Podcast: Netty and Armeria founder Trustin Lee](https://spring.io/blog/2021/01/07/a-bootiful-podcast-netty-and-armeria-founder-trustin-lee) | by @trustin and @joshlong

## We need your comments

ü§î Your opinion means a lot to us. Please let us know what you think about these proposals:

- #3051 Use context for when the subscriber is created by Reactor, not Publisher
- #3155 Unify gRPC timeout scheduler between gRPC server and client.

## Good first issues

Want to contribute but not sure where to start from? Try one of these:

- #3315 Programmatically create a blocking task executor with a custom thread size,
  perhaps by adding a new builder method to <type://ServerBuilder> that takes the number of threads.
