## What is Armeria?

_Armeria_ is your go-to microservice framework for any situation. You can build any type of
microservice leveraging your favorite technologies, including [gRPC](https://grpc.io/),
[Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/),
[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/), [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/),
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/).

It is open-sourced by the creator of [Netty](https://netty.io/) and his colleagues at
[LY Corporation](https://techblog.lycorp.co.jp/en).

## Features

### HTTP/2

- Supports HTTP/2 on both TLS and cleartext connections
- Supports protocol upgrade via both HTTP/2 connection preface and traditional HTTP/1 upgrade request
- Fully compatible with existing HTTP/1 servers
- Integrated PROXY protocol support for interoperability with load balancers such as HAProxy and AWS ELB.

### Integration with gRPC and Thrift

- Your gRPC or Thrift service implementation runs on top of Armeria without any modification.
- Works with the official gRPC or Thrift-over-HTTP client
- Works with the code generated by the official Protobuf or Thrift IDL compiler
- Supports various protocol combinations, such as:
  - gRPC-over-HTTP/1 & 2
  - Thrift-over-HTTP/1 & 2
  - gRPC-Web
- See [Running a Thrift service](/docs/server-thrift) and [Running a gRPC service](/docs/server-grpc).

### Essential features for building microservices

- Metrics
- Circuit breaker
- Client-side health-check and load-balancing
- Service discovery from various sources such as DNS and ZooKeeper
  - See [Client-side load balancing and service discovery](/docs/client-service-discovery).
- Distributed call tracing via Zipkin

### Interactive web-based debug console

- Browse the list of available RPC operations
- Invoke an RPC operation via a web form
- Share an RPC request with your colleagues so they can reproduce the problem easily
  - Just like sharing a cURL command, but works for RPC
- See [Browsing and invoking services with DocService](/docs/server-docservice).

### Completely asynchronous and reactive

- Built on top of Reactive Streams and Java 8 CompletableFuture
- Asynchronous connection pool ensures your application never blocks even on pool exhaustion.
- Domain name lookups are also fully asynchronous thanks to Netty’s asynchronous domain name resolver.

### Compatibility with existing Java EE web applications

- Runs any Java EE web applications such as Spring Boot on the same TCP/IP port
- Your Java EE web application speaks HTTP/2!
- See [Embedding a servlet container](/docs/server-servlet).

### Even higher performance on Linux

- JNI-based socket I/O
- BoringSSL-based TLS connections
