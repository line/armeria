/**
 * A variant of <a href="http://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive Streams</a> {@link Publisher}, which allows
 * only one {@link Subscriber}. Unlike a usual {@link Publisher}, a {@link StreamMessage} can stream itself
 * only once.  It has the following additional operations on top of what the Reactive Streams API provides:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #isOpen()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #isEmpty()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #completionFuture()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #abort()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>When is a {@link StreamMessage} fully consumed?</h3>
 *
 * <p>A {@link StreamMessage} is <em>complete</em> (or 'fully consumed') when:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the {@link Subscriber} consumes all elements and {@link Subscriber#onComplete()} is invoked,</li>
 *   <li>an error occurred and {@link Subscriber#onError(Throwable)} is invoked,</li>
 *   <li>the {@link Subscription} has been cancelled or</li>
 *   <li>{@link #abort()} has been requested.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When fully consumed, the {@link CompletableFuture} returned by {@link StreamMessage#completionFuture()}
 * will complete, which you may find useful because {@link Subscriber} does not notify you when a stream is
 * {@linkplain Subscription#cancel() cancelled}.
 *
 * <h3>Publication and Consumption of {@link ReferenceCounted} objects</h3>
 *
 * <p>{@link StreamMessage} will reject the publication request of a {@link ReferenceCounted} object except
 * {@link ByteBuf} and {@link ByteBufHolder}.
 *
 * <p>{@link StreamMessage} will discard the publication request of a {@link ByteBuf} or a {@link ByteBufHolder}
 * silently and release it automatically when the publication is attempted after the stream is closed.
 *
 * <p>For {@link ByteBuf} and {@link ByteBufHolder}, {@link StreamMessage} will convert them into their
 * respective unpooled versions that never leak, so that the {@link Subscriber} does not need to worry about
 * leaks.
 *
 * <p>If a {@link Subscriber} does not want a {@link StreamMessage} to make a copy of a {@link ByteBufHolder},
 * use {@link #subscribe(Subscriber, boolean)} or {@link #subscribe(Subscriber, EventExecutor, boolean)} and
 * specify {@code true} for {@code withPooledObjects}. Note that the {@link Subscriber} is responsible for
 * releasing the objects given with {@link Subscriber#onNext(Object)}.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of element signaled
