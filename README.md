# Armeria

_Armeria_ is an open-source asynchronous RPC/API client/server library built on top of [Java 8](http://java.oracle.com/), [Netty 4.1](http://netty.io/), [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/), and [Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/). Its primary goal is to help engineers build high-performance asynchronous Thrift microservices that use HTTP/2 as a session layer protocol, although it is designed to be protocol-agnostic and highly extensible (for example, you can serve a directory of static files via HTTP/2 and run Java EE web applications).

It is open-sourced and licensed under [Apache License 2.0](https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0)) by [LINE Corporation](http://linecorp.com/en/), who uses it in production.
