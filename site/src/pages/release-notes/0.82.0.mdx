## New features

- You can now include or exclude service methods using `DocServiceFilter` when building a `DocService`.
  See [our documentation](https://armeria.dev/docs/server-docservice#including-and-excluding-service-methods) for more information. #1609
  ```java
  ServerBuilder sb = new ServerBuilder();
  ...
  sb.serviceUnder("/docs", new DocServiceBuilder()
          // Include Thrift services and Annotated services.
          .include(DocServiceFilter.ofThrift().or(DocServiceFilter.ofAnnotated()))
          // Exclude the method whose name is "foo" in Thrift services.
          .exclude(DocServiceFilter.ofThrift().and(DocServiceFilter.ofMethodName("foo")))
          .build());
  ```
- `HttpHeaderNames` now forks from Guava's `HttpHeaders` instead of Netty's `HttpHeaderNames` 
  because it has more recent HTTP headers which may be useful to service authors.
- You can use `SystemInfo` utility class in order to get the system information. #1656
  ```java
  // Java version
  SystemInfo.javaVersion();

  // Hostname
  SystemInfo.hostname();

  // The current process ID
  SystemInfo.pid();

  // The current time in microseconds
  SystemInfo.currentTimeMicros();
  ```

## Improvements

- Set 0.5 to the default failure rate threshold of a circuit breaker. #1657
- Various documentation updates. #1657 #1654 #1651

## Bug fixes

- Strip a leading slash in an `HttpFile` resource path. #1661 #1650
  ```java
  // Will strip the leading slash
  HttpFile.ofResource(ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader(), "/java/lang/Object.class");
  ```
- `ByteBuf`s are no longer leaked when you use Spring WebFlux integration. #1658
  It was possible to leak a `ByteBuf` if a client closes a connection before reading the body of an HTTP response.

## Breaking Change

- `DocServicePlugin` interface now has `name()` method and `generateSpecification()` method signature has changed. #1609
  ```java
  // Before:
  ServiceSpecification generateSpecification(Set<ServiceConfig> serviceConfigs);
  // After:
  String name();
  ServiceSpecification generateSpecification(Set<ServiceConfig> serviceConfigs, DocServiceFilter filter);
  ```
-  Some header names in `HttpHeaderNames` were removed, although it is very unlikely to be used by users: #1660
  - `Keep-Alive`
  - `Proxy-Connection`
  - `Content-Transfer-Encoding`
