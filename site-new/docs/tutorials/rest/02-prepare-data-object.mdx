# Preparing a data object

Before we get into writing a blog service, first prepare a data object to contain blog post information. This object is used also in handling requests and sending responses.

If you want a quick start, skip this step and copy off the [BlogPost.java](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/blob/main/tutorials/rest-api-annotated-service/src/main/java/example/armeria/server/blog/BlogPost.java) of the sample service code.
