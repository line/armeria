# Creating a server

As the first step of the tutorial, we create a server instance and run a dummy service to check that the server and service are launched.
We'll use Armeria's <type://ServerBuilder> for this task.

<TutorialSteps current={1} />

## What you need

You don't need to prepare anything at this stage.
Just check that you've prepared the [prerequisites](/tutorials/tutorial-blog-rest-intro/#prerequisites).

## 1. Create a server instance

Let's create a server instance using Armeria's <type://ServerBuilder>:

1. Create a main class and add in import statements. You can see the full version of the file [here](https://github.com/line/armeria-examples/blob/master/rest-api-annotated-service/src/main/java/example/armeria/server/blog/Main.java).
  ```java filename=Main.java
  package example.armeria.server.blog;

  import org.slf4j.Logger;
  import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

  import com.linecorp.armeria.common.HttpResponse;
  import com.linecorp.armeria.server.Server;
  import com.linecorp.armeria.server.ServerBuilder;

  public final class Main {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);
  }
  ```
2. In the `Main` class, add the method, `newServer()`. Since a server instance requires at least one service to run with, let's add a dummy service returning `"Hello, Armeria!"` for now.
  ```java filename=Main.java highlight=4
  static Server newServer(int port) {
    ServerBuilder sb = Server.builder();
    return sb.http(port)
             .service("/", (ctx, req) -> HttpResponse.of("Hello, Armeria!"))
             .build();
  }
  ```

Later on, when we build our blog service, we'll come back to this part of the code to [add an actual service](/tutorials/tutorial-blog-rest-step7).

## 2. Start the server

Now that we have a server, have a go at starting the server with the dummy service.

1. In the `Main` class, add the `main()` method.
2. Call the `newServer()` method we implemented in step 2. Let's set the port to `8080` as in line 2.
3. Start the server as in line 9.

```java filename=Main.java highlight=2,9
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  Server server = newServer(8080);

  Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> {
      server.stop().join();
      logger.info("Server has been stopped.");
  }));

  server.start().join();

  logger.info("Server has been started. Serving dummy service at http://127.0.0.1:{}",
              server.activeLocalPort());
}
```

## 3. Run the server and service

As the last step, launch the server and run the service to check if you're all set to go. To run the server, run the `main()` method in your IDE. The server and service are launched successfully if you see the following message.

```bash
 Server has been started. Serving dummy service at http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Open the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8080` on a web browser and check the message `Hello, Armeria!` is displayed in the page.

## What's next

In this step, you've built a server, added a dummy service and launched a server.

Next, at [Step 2. Prepare a data object](/tutorials/tutorial-blog-rest-step2), you will write a data object to specify and contain blog post information.
