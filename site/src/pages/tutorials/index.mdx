# Armeria tutorials

Learn how to write a service with Armeria by walking through this tutorial.
The tutorial takes you through steps based on a sample service, a blog service, to offer you practical guidance.

## Try running the service

Before you dive into coding, try running the sample blog service to get an idea of the service.
Thanks to Armeria's [Documentation service](/docs/server-docservice), you can view a list of APIs the service provides and make API calls to see how to use the service.
