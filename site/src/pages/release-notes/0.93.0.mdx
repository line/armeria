## New features

- You can now create a `Sampler` from a specification string such as `random=0.1` and `rate-limited=10`. #2108
  - This is going to be useful when you want to make the sampling policy of `Brave{Client,Server}` or `Logging{Client,Server}` configurable from external sources such as a configuration file or a system property.
  ```java
  Sampler<Object> randomSampler = Sampler.of("random=0.1");
  Sampler<Object> rateLimitedSampler = Sampler.of("rate-limited=10");
  Sampler<Object> alwaysSampler = Sampler.of("always");
  Sampler<Object> neverSampler = Sampler.of("never");
  ```
- You can now specify the `Sampler` specification string in the `com.linecorp.armeria.verboseExceptions` system property. #2105 #2111
  - From this release, the default value of this property is `rate-limited=10` which means the stack trace of the exceptions will be recorded at the maximum rate of 10 exceptions/sec. Previously, the default value of this property was `false`, which eliminates all stack traces, which gave our users a hard time figuring out why.
- You can now specify a common path prefix using `@PathPrefix` annotation in annotated services. #2031 #2099

  ```java
  @PathPrefix("/users")
  public class MyUserService {
      @Get("/{id}") // Mapped to '/users/{id}'
      @ProducesJson
      public User getUser(@Param int id) { ... }
      ...
  }

  Server server = new ServerBuilder()
      .annotatedService(new MyUserService())
      .build();
  ```

## Bug fixes

- Fixed a memory leak in `HealthCheckService`. #2110
- Prometheus and Dropwizard Metrics are now optional dependencies in `armeria-spring-boot-*`. #2106 #2107
- `armeria-spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure` does not refuse to start anymore when `HealthStatusHttpMapper` is missing. #2104

## Breaking changes

- `Flags.verboseExceptions()` has been replaced with `verboseExceptionSampler()` and `verboseExceptionSamplerSpec()`. #2111
- `Exceptions.isVerbose()`, which was deprecated previously, has been removed. #2111
- You may need to add `io.micrometer:micrometer-registry-prometheus` or `io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-json` after upgrading if you were depending on them transitively. #2107

## Dependencies

- Netty 4.1.41 -> 4.1.42
- Netty TCNative BoringSSL 2.0.25 -> 2.0.26
- Project Reactor 3.2.12 -> 3.3.0
- Prometheus 0.6.0 -> 0.7.0
- Retrofit 2.6.1 -> 2.6.2
